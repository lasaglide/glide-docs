# Inline Templates

Add one or multiple column values in component data fields by typing @

### Inline Template Rich Block 1

Inline Templates allow you to mention columns by name much like you would tag a person in a chat or on social media. You can either type `@column-name` or type `@` and select the column from the menu that opens.

Inline Templates show the column values for the item you're viewing. When you update data in your table, the text in your app updates automatically. You can select multiple columns and mix column data with manual text as needed.

To browse all column options without typing, select the four dots to the right of the Data field in the component settings menu.

You can use Inline Templates in any component field that has four dots next to it.
