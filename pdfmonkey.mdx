### PDF Monkey Block 3

To make a PDF, you just need to give your PDFMonkey `Template ID` and desired `Filename`.

If you want to put information from Glide into your PDF, you can switch out placeholders in the template with `+Add value` .

Once the PDF is created, a link to it will be saved in the field you specify for `File output`.

The action can be added to a [Component](/components) that supports Actions (e.g., a [Button component](/button-components)), added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor), or after a [Form](/forms) is submitted.

### PDFMonkey Example Text

## Example: Enhancing Engagement with Personalized Promotional Flyers

SwiftCourier, a leading courier service, continually seeks innovative ways to engage its loyal customer base. With an upcoming promotional offer, they aimed not only to reach their customers but also to establish a personal connection with them.

Recognizing the impact of personalization, SwiftCourier decided to create individualized promotional flyers tailored to each customer. However, given their extensive customer base, manual flyer creation would be time-consuming and error-prone.

This is where the PDFMonkey integration with Glide comes into play.

### **Setting Up the Personalized Flyer Generation**

After integrating PDFMonkey with Glide, a PDFMonkey template was created to serve as the foundation for the promotional flyers. The template includes placeholders for specific customer details:

- Customer Name
- Date of their last order
- A unique discount code

### **Generating the Personalized Flyers**

Back in Glide, a button was added to each customer's profile dedicated to the promotion. When clicked, this button initiates a workflow, starting with the PDFMonkey action to generate the flyer. The action includes the PDF Monkey template ID, the customer data for the template, and the field to store the final PDF link.

### **Distributing the Flyers**

Once the PDF is generated, the [Gmail](/automation/integrations/gmail) integration can be used to send the flyer directly to the customer. This streamlined process allows SwiftCourier to send the custom offer with just a button press.

Customers receive an email containing their personalized PDF flyer, fostering a sense of value and increasing the likelihood of them taking up the promotional offer.

### **The Results**

The outcome? A significant increase in customer engagement and participation in the promotional offer.

Through using the PDFMonkey integration with Glide, SwiftCourier transformed what could have been a burdensome task into an automated, efficient process. They delivered a tailored experience to their customers, enhancing their overall satisfaction and engagement.
