# Contact Form

A preconfigured contact form for your page. 

### Contact Form Body 1

**Contact Form** is a quick way to add a simple ‘Contact Us' form to your page.

## Adding and Setting Up a Contact Form



### Contact Form Arcade

### Adding Contact Form Directions

1. In the [Layout Editor](/intro-to-layout), select the tab you want to edit.
2. Click on the plus (+) symbol in the [Components](/components) panel and select the **Contact Form** component.
3. Locate the **Data** section on the right of the Layout Editor. Use the menus in **Title** and **Description** to select the values from your data to display, or select **Custom** to enter [Custom Values](/custom-values) for these fields.
4. Select the **Target Table **from your [Data Source](/data-sources). The Target Table will be the destination for your form submissions, so you may need to add a new table to your data source to capture responses.
5. Assign the appropriate columns from your data source to store the user's **Name, Email, Phone**, and **Message** fields.



### [BLANK] Contact Form Minimum Requirements

The Contact Form requires, at a minimum, a user's **Email** address and a **Message** in order to submit the form. Other optional fields include the user's **Name** and **Phone** number.

### Additional Columns + Actions

### Additional Columns

In the **Layout Editor**, locate the **Additional Columns** section. Any columns from your **Target Table** that were not assigned to the **Name**, **Email**, **Phone**, or **Message** fields will be available as additional columns.

Additional Columns capture information from the current screen or the [User Profile](/user-profiles) table. These can be especially useful if you've included contact forms on multiple pages. For example, suppose you assign an Additional Column that captures the specific title of the page. In that case, you'll be able to quickly see what content the submission is referencing without the user having to manually enter this as part of their form submission. You can also use custom values here.

### Actions

You can also trigger an [Action](/getting-started/introduction-to-actions) when a user submits the Contact Form. You can choose from any of the actions available in Glide, or you can create a new action. Glide will automatically add a new row to your **Target Table** when the Contact Form is submitted, so you do not need to include an **Add Row** action here.
