# User Profile Columns

Work with user data from anywhere in your app.

### User Profile Column Body Text

If you have **User Profiles** enabled in your app, you can submit User Profile columns in [Forms](/docs/use-cases/forms).

For example, the app below shows you **Viewing as** a user called Alma Malmberg. When you configure your **Add item** Screen's components, you can also submit values from the current user's profile. For example, you could add the Name of the person that added this item, their title, and their photo.

Now, when a user submits a new item, their name, title, and photo properties will be added to the row.

You can compute these values with [Relations](/automation/computed-columns/relations) and [Lookups](/automation/computed-columns/lookup-column) by submitting the user's email, relating that email to the user profiles table, and then looking up the necessary information. However, User Profile columns may be a simpler option for your use case—with the added benefit that the values get written to [Basic Columns](/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor/basic-columns)—which means they appear in your sheet!

## Assigning the user's Role column

Submitting User Profile Column values is particularly useful when it comes to [Roles](/essentials/security-and-user-data/roles) as it allows you to automatically secure the row that gets added and make it accessible only to people with the same role as the person who added it.

For example:

Let's say that Alma has the role of "Management." When she submits a new row, you can make sure that her "Management" role value gets added to our [Row Owners](/essentials/security-and-user-data/row-owners) column in whatever table we're submitting to. We just need to add a User Profile column in our Add or Form screen.

Now, automatically, the row she added will populate the Row Owner's column with "Management." This means that this row is now secure and only visible to those with the role of "Management."

You can of course use [Array Columns](/automation/computed-columns/make-array-column) if you want the row you're adding to be accessible to multiple roles.
