# Relations

Create relationships and link rows together.

### Introduction to Relations Video

### Relations Body 1

**Relations** create relationships between rows, linking their data across tables.

## About Relations

In a Glide app, every row in your tables represents an item that then appears in the components in your app.

Each **item** has its own **properties**. These are represented as columns in the same table. For example:

- A **Room **can have a: **Number**, **Floor**, **Extension**, **Desks**, **Image**
- An **Employee **can have a: **Name**, **Number**, **Email**, **Image**
- A **Product **can have a: **Name**, **SKU**, **Image**, **Price**, **Description**

In some cases, an **item** can contain an **item **from another table. These are represented as columns across multiple tables. For example:

- A **Room **has an **Occupant**
- An **Employee **has a **Manager **and an **Office**
- A **Product **has a **Category**

When an item contains other items, they each have their own set of properties and exist as independent rows in tables. They can then be connected by building relations.

## Single vs Multiple Relations

Relations fall into two categories: single relations and multiple relations.

A single relation create a **one-to-one **relationship. This means one item relates to just one other item. For example, a staff member has a location they work from, or a product has one warehouse it's stored in. 

Multiple relations show a **one-to-many** relationship. This is where one item relates to multiple other items. For example, a manager oversees multiple staff members, or a product belongs in multiple categories.

## Creating relations in Glide

In Glide, you can create relations between values using a **Relation** column. With this column, you specify the type of relation you want—single or multiple. Your app then applies the relation to the values and tables specified.

### Check for matching values

Before adding a **Relation** column, you must first check that the values match in the columns that will be connected. Items cannot be linked together unless they match.

For example, a relation can be created for an employee directory that has a **Staff** table and **a Locations** table. In the **Staff** table, make sure there's a column for the name of the employee's Location.
In the **Locations** table, make sure there's a column for the name of the location that can be tied to the Staff table.

By connecting this information, you can integrate it into components or even link to their location in their profile.

Even if the columns have different names in each table, the values in them are shared.

After determining that there are matching values, you can build single or multiple relations using the **Relation** column.

## Building Single Relations



### Adding Relation Column Arcade

### Relations Body 7

To create a single relation:

1. In the [Data Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor), open the table you want to edit.
2. Add a new column by clicking the plus symbol to the right of the table.- New columns added with the plus button will always appear on the right. If you'd like to add a column somewhere else in your data, you can select the dropdown menu on an existing column and choose **Add column right. **You can also click and drag columns to rearrange them. 
3. Name the column.
4. For **Type**, search for **Relation **or navigate to **Computed -> Relation. **
5. Specify the values to be matched. Values must match exactly to create a relation. The values in the column will automatically populate when a match is found. If they still appear empty after selecting both columns, the values in the columns do not match and a relation cannot be established.
6. Click on **Done** to add the new column to the table.

## Building Multiple Relations

To create a multiple relation:

1. In the **Data Editor**, open the table you want to edit.
2. Add a new column by clicking the plus (+) symbol to the right of the table.- New columns added with the plus button will always appear on the right. If you'd like to add a column somewhere else in your data, you can select the dropdown menu on an existing column and choose **Add column right. **You can also click and drag columns to rearrange them. 
3. Name the column.
4. For **Type**, search for **Relation **or navigate to **Computed -> Relation. **
5. Specify the values to be matched. Values must match exactly to create a relation. The values in the column will automatically populate when a match is found. If they still appear empty after selecting both columns, the values in the columns do not match and a relation cannot be established.
6. Enable the **Match multiple **option.
7. Click on **Done** to add the new column to the table.

## Using Relations

The most common use for a **Relation** column in Glide is to display a single related item or list of items. This is done with [Collections](/essentials/components/collection-components).

With that said, you may find more advanced ways to use multiple relations, such as in [Choice Components](/choice-component) or as the source for the data displayed in [Charts](/charts).
