## Customizing Charts

Glide charts are highly customizable based on what type of data you connect, as well as how you choose to visualize it. Each chart style unlocks new ways to display data, so we recommend trying different options as you build your chart.

### Customizing by Value

Clicking any specific value in the component's menu let’s you customize that specific value further. You can add a caption for the value and change the color selection mode from auto (the default) to manual. Manual color values support both color names written in English and hex codes.

### Additional Options

Opening the **Options** tab in the component customization menu shows additional adjustments you can make to each chart:

- [Visibility](/use-cases/conditions-filtering-and-visibility) and [Filter conditions](/reference/user-experience/visibility-conditions) can be set up to limit which users can see the chart, and which data is displayed.
- Data can be sorted by different variables.
- A manual search bar for the chart data can be toggled on or off.
- In-app filtering can be enabled by adding a filter item. Additional filter values can be added with the **+ Add filter **button. These will appear as filter options for users on the chart.
- Custom CSS for styling is available.
- Builder notes can be added as needed.
