1. In the [Layout Editor](/intro-to-layout), select the tab you want to edit.
2. Click on the plus (+) symbol in the [Components](/components) panel.
3. Find **Forms** in the menu and select **Form Container**.
4. The container will automatically guess which table to add your form submissions to. To change this, select the form container and choose a different **Target table **on the right of the Layout Editor.** **
5. The form container will create fields based on the **Target table**. You can add or remove these fields as needed. 
6. Choose a background for your form if desired.
7. Decide what [Action](/getting-started/introduction-to-actions) should trigger when a user submits the form. By default, the action will show a notification that says “Success.” You can use any action here, or trigger an integration as part of a larger workflow. 
8. Each component inside of your form container can also be customized. The options for customization will depend on what type of component you’re using. For every entry, you can decide if users will be required to fill it out. 
9. Select as many **Form Elements **as you need and customize each one to create a comprehensive form for your needs.
