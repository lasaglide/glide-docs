## Use Cases

The integration between Pexels and Glide offers a simple way to incorporate high-quality stock photos into your app. Here are a few scenarios of how you could use Pexels in your app:

1. **Event Banners**: Elevate your event promotion using captivating images that capture the essence of the event and attract attendees.
2. **Marketing Campaigns**: Use Pexels images to enhance your marketing campaigns with professional and eye-catching visuals.
3. **Product Listings**: Take your product presentations up a notch by integrating striking images from Pexels that highlight satisfied customers.

## Example: Enhancing Blog Post Banners

Let's consider the case of BoxSource, a prominent shipping box manufacturer. Weekly, they release an internal blog, a means to keep their company well-informed, minimizing the need for mundane meetings. Despite the valuable content, the presentation often falls flat, resulting in pages filled with monotonous text.

Recognizing the potency of visuals in boosting content engagement, they opt to give their internal blog a facelift with the assistance of the Pexels integration.

### Pexels Block 4

After integrating Pexels with Glide, Boxsource adds the [Extract Keywords](/automation/integrations/openai-and-glide#extract-keywords) column to their **Blogs** table. This column takes the blog article as an input and return a list of keywords found in the provided text.

With the list of keywords for each blog post, Boxsource can now add the **Stock Photo for Text **column to retrieve a relevant image for each blog post. The column takes the keywords as an input and returns a photo that can be displayed with the blog.

### The Results

The transformation is immediate. The once dull internal blog now showcases dynamic and relevant images, significantly enhancing the appeal of each post. HR soon reports a noticeable uptick in the number of staff interacting with the weekly updates.
