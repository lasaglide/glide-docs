# Button

Use buttons to trigger actions in your apps.

### Button Component - Arcade 1

### Button Body Text

Buttons can be configured to trigger different [Actions](/actions) when your users tap or click on them.

The **Button** (or **Button Block**) component allows you to add one or more buttons in a horizontal or vertical layout.

### Button Component - Block 3

1. In the [Layout Editor](/intro-to-layout), select the tab you want to edit.
2. Click on the plus (+) symbol in the [Components** **](/components)panel and add the **Button **component. 
3. Select the **Style **for your button. You can choose **Basic**, **Minimal**, or **Tiles**.
4. Select the **Width** of your button. **Auto** will adjust the button's width depending on the length of the label. **Wide** will give your button extra padding even if the label is short.
5. Choosing **Accent** will add an accent to your button and button title. The **Accent** option is only available for **Basic** and **Minimal** styles.
6. You can also select between **Show** and **Hide** for the label on your Button component.

## Using Actions with Buttons

You can include multiple buttons by adding more actions to the component. Inside each action, **Title** fields act as each button's label.
