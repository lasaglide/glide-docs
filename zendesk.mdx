# Zendesk

Streamlines ticketing, self-service, and automation processes.

### Zendesk - Block 1

[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) is a platform that connects businesses to their customers. Zendesk’s Chat widget allows your users to chat with team members from your company. By connecting Zendesk to your app, you can chat with your users in real-time and allow them to send messages to your Zendesk inbox when you are not available.
