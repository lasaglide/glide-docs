# System Requirements

The minimum system requirements to build and use Glide apps.

### System Requirements - Block 1

## Browser requirements (builder)

When you're making your app in the builder, it's best to use the latest version of your browser. Glide supports the current and previous major version of each browser. You can review the version release history for each of our supported browsers below:

- [Chrome](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/)
- [Safari](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/releases/)

Other browsers may work (particularly **Chromium** based browsers), but we recommend using one of the above for maximum compatibility.

Glide currently does not support:

- **Microsoft Edge **
- **Internet Explorer**
- **Opera Mini**



### Building apps in Glide

We recommend using computers to build apps in Glide, rather than mobile devices.

### System Requirements - Block 1

## Browser requirements for using Glide apps

When using Glide apps on phones, we officially support

- **Chrome **on Android
