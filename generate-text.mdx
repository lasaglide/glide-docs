# Generate Text

Generate text from data in your app.

### Generate Text Body 1

With the **Generate Text **feature, generate text from existing text, a given context, a data input, or a set of parameters. This can be useful for creating automated responses, content generation, or even simulating human-like conversation within an app.

## Adding the Generate Text feature

### In the Data Editor

### Generate Text Body 2

1. Open the table where you want to use the **Generate Text** feature.
2. Add a new basic text column for the **Input**. The input can be any column that contains text, so if you’ve used another action or computed column to create a text result, you can also use that text result as the Input source. - New columns added with the plus button will always appear on the right. If you'd like to add a column somewhere else in your data, you can select the dropdown menu on an existing column and choose **Add column right.** You can also click and drag columns to rearrange them.
3. Add a **Generate Text **column to store the result. Search for "Generate Text” or navigate to **AI → Generate Text**. 
4. For the **Instructions**, add instructions to create more specificity for your prompt.  
5. For the** Input**, use the **Input** column created previously.
6. **Note:** If the action will be triggered in the Workflow Editor, then add a basic text **Result** column where the result will be stored.
7. Click on **Done**.

### In the Layout Editor

3. In the configuration panel on the right, in the **Actions** menu, select the **Generate Text ** action.
4. Name the action and choose an icon.
5. For **Instructions,** enter custom text to create more specificity for your prompt.

8. To display the text that results from the action, add a [Text Component](/essentials/components/text) and use your results column as the source. This will instantly show the generated text to your users. 
9. To enable users to adjust the instructions, add a [Text Entry Component](/essentials/components/entry) pointing to an **Instructions** column with the adjustments you want made.
