Send an invoice with Stripe

### Stripe - Block 2

1. In Glide, click the Settings icon in the upper-right corner.
2. Navigate to the [Integrations](/introduction-to-integrations) tab and then select [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
3. Click the **Add to app **button.
4. Next, log into your [Stripe Account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) to get your API Key.
5. Select **Create secret key, **give it a **Name**, and copy your new Stripe API key.
6. Back in Glide, enter this **API Key **in your Stripe Integration settings.

## Send Invoice

The Stripe integration **Send Invoice** action allows you to create and send invoices to customers right from your app. This feature can be added inside a component that supports actions or added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor). 

### **Required Inputs**

To create an invoice, you need to provide the following information: `Email`, `Total`, and `Currency`.

Make sure to specify the smallest unit of currency for the total amount. For instance, if you want to create an invoice for $14.25, you would input 1425, as 1425 cents is 14.25 dollars.

You can review a full list of support currencies [here](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).

### **Optional Inputs**

If you want to connect this invoice with your existing Stripe data, you can also include the `Product ID`, `Price ID`, or `Customer ID`.

These IDs can be found in your Stripe [Products](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products) and [Customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) sections.

### **Outputs**

Once the invoice is successfully created, Stripe will provide you with the resulting `Invoice ID`, `Price ID`, and `Product ID`. These details can be stored in Glide for future reference.

To view your invoices, make a clickable link using the Invoice ID:

1. Save the Invoice ID you get from Stripe
2. Make a new [Template Column](/template-column)
3. Use this link: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/{your_invoice_id}`

### Setting up the Send invoice action

5. Choose an icon.
6. Enter the required fields: Recipient email, total, and currency.

8. Stripe will return an **Invoice ID**, **Price ID**, and **Product ID**. Choose where you'd like to store this data.
9. Click away to exit the configuration.
