# Record and Transcribe Voice

Record and convert spoken words to text automatically.

### Record and transcribe voice - Block 1

The **Record and transcribe voice** integration allows users to record audio and receive text transcriptions instantly. 

The action can be added to any [Component](/essentials/components) that supports [Actions](/automation/actions) (e.g., a [Button component](/essentials/components/button)) or added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor). To create a component that automatically records and transcribes text, try the [Voice Transcription component](/essentials/components/voice-transcription). 

## Setting up the Record and Transcribe Voice Action

### In the Layout Editor



### Record and transcribe voice - Arcade 1

### Record and transcribe voice - Block 2

1. Select the component you'd like to add the action to. Remember, this must be a component that supports actions.
2. In the actions settings, search for the **Record and transcribe voice** action. - Note: The Google Cloud integration also offers a [Transcribe audio](/automation/integrations/google-cloud) action. Make sure you select the correct one.

7. Enter a **Placeholder** text for the transcription area.
8. Toggle **Auto-record** on if you want recording to start automatically when the action is triggered.
