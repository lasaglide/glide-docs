# Preview and Beta Features

Experiment with new features before they’re released.

### Preview Features - Block 1

## What are Preview Features?

Before being fully integrated into the builder, some Glide features can be previewed by enabling them in your [Dashboard](/docs/getting-started/quick-start/glide-dashboard). Preview features are experimental. While users can test and use them, there might be some differences between the preview and the final release of the feature.

Glide releases features in Preview and Beta stages before they are ready for General Availability.

During the Preview stages, features should be used for experimentation and demos only. Preview features can contain **critical bugs** that may cause apps to crash. The Glide team may also make **breaking changes** to the feature, meaning new updates could cause any instances of the feature already in use to break.

Once a feature is in the Beta stage, the feature can be used in production apps but may still experience minor bugs and issues. Minor bugs and issues could temporarily cause a feature to stop working, or make it difficult to use a feature until the Glide team can make a fix. Features in beta can be deprecated or discontinued at any time.

A feature is considered stable once it reaches General Availability.

### Stability of experimental features

Please proceed with caution for apps with users, and report bugs in the Glide Community forum under the [bugs category](https://community.glideapps.com/c/bugs/7).

### Preview Features - Block 2

## Enabling Preview Features

Enable preview features in the Glide Dashboard to get a sneak peek of what’s upcoming.

### [BLANK] Preview Features - Callout 2

Note that some features require a [paid plan](/docs/reference/account/plans-and-pricing). If you enable a feature that is not available on your plan, you will see a popup prompting you to upgrade when you try to use the feature in your apps. 

### Preview Features - Block 3

By default, preview features are not enabled for testing. They can be activated through the toggle switch associated with the feature. You can choose to enable as many, or as few, preview features you like.

### Preview Features

Once activated, the experimental features will be accessible in all applications associated with your account.

When an experimental feature moves from preview to a standard release, it will generally operate as you've configured it. However, once the standard release is announced, we recommend reviewing your configuration to make sure it’s still functioning the way you intended.
