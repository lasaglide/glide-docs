# Google Gemini

Connect Google Gemini to Glide.

### Google Gemini - Block 1

The Google Gemini integration integrate’s Google’s Gemini AI model directly into Glide apps. Gemini is a generative AI tool built on large language models. [You can read more about Gemini and the available models here.](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini)

### Don't see the Gemini integration?

You may need to upgrade your plan. [Browse Glide's plans and find the right fit for you.](https://www.glideapps.com/pricing)

### Google Gemini - Block 2

## Adding the Integration

To add the integration, you’ll first need a Google account with access to the Gemini web app. If you have a Workspace account, you may not have access. [You can review the different types of access from Google here.](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13278668?hl=en)

Once you have created an API key in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/), you can add the integration to your Glide app.

### Google Gemini - Arcade 1

1. In Glide, click the Settings icon in the upper-right corner.
2. Navigate to the **Integrations** tab and then select **Google Gemini**.
3. Click the **Add to app** button.
4. Paste the API key you want to use from Google AI Studio.
5. Click away to exit the configuration.

## Generate Text

The **Generate Text** feature will generate a text output in response to a message input. You can also enable [Gemini’s code execution ability](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/code-execution?lang=python) in the advanced configuration settings.

The feature can be configured as a column in the [Data Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor) or as an action in the [Layout](/getting-started/intro-to-layout#layout-editor) or [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor).
