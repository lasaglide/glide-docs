# Screen Values

Values that you can access from the current screen.

### Screen Values Body Text

Occasionally you will see the option to work with **Screen values** in Glide. Screen values are useful when working with Forms or Inline Lists. Let's look at two examples.

## In Forms

Take a look at using Screen Values to filter a [Choice component](/essentials/components/choice) using the inventory template.



![Screen Value Example 1](https://images.ctfassets.net/yreygbm72t08/1hJLTnwuRDNqcA1f8ueYxN/7b8642e4dca2b1203998ce1fcd94bb3e/CleanShot_2023-11-07_at_1_.29.33_2x.png)



This screen shows a user adding a new inspection. This is a [**Form**](/form-container) screen.

In this app, there are many properties and each property has multiple units. When you pick a property, you only want to have to choose from a list of units within that property. You don't want to pick from a list of all units from all properties.

You can therefore add a [Filter](/reference/user-experience/filter) on the **Choice component** that says: "Only show units where the property ID matches the property ID selected in the current screen."

## Filtering Collections

Another use case for using **Screen Values** is when you have collections.

When you have a collection, you have two contexts:

1. The row of the current screen
2. The rows of the collection

Without screen values, the collection doesn't know what screen it is being shown on. With screen values, you can use the containing screen's values in your conditions.

For example, showing a list of related items without showing the current item.
