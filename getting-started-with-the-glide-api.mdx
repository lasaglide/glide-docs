# Getting Started with the Glide API

A guide to working with the Glide Tables Basic API.

### Introduction to APIs

Learn the [fundamentals of APIs](https://www.glideapps.com/blog/introduction-to-apis).

### Getting Started with the Glide API - Block 1

## Who has access to Glide API?

Glide API is available with Business and Enterprise plans. 

Connecting to your [**Glide Tables**](/glide-tables) via the API lets you automate your data management and integrate it with your own applications. With the API you can:

1. Add row to table
2. Set columns in row
3. Delete row

If you have the Business or Enterprise plan, you also have access to get rows and query [Big Tables](/big-tables) with SQL. Need to upgrade? [Click here to see all our plans.](https://www.glideapps.com/pricing)

### Getting Started with the Glide API - Block 2

## How do I access Glide API?

To get started:

- Open the [**Data Editor**](/data-editor).
- At the bottom of any Glide Table, click **Show API**.
- You can also go to the right-click on the table icon and select **show API**.

When working with the API, you will pass a unique API Key, sometimes labeled a Bearer Token. It's a long sequence of random numbers and letters that looks like this: `2F2733E2-2B70-4291-8250-633B9E8F16AF` Treat this as a password—it's a secret that you shouldn't share.

The **API Instructions** screen displays the calls to use to take the available actions.
