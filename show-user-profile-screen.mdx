# Show User Profile Screen

Bring the user to their profile screen. 

### Show User Profile Screen Body Text 1

The **Show User Profile Screen** action will bring the user to their profile screen in your app.

The **Show User Profile Screen** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [**Collections**](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [**Custom Action**](/getting-started/introduction-to-actions).

## **Setting up the Show User Profile Action**

### In the Layout Editor

1. Click on the plus (+) sign in the **Components** panel and select the **Component** you want to trigger the action.
2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and select **Show user profile screen**.
3. You can optionally add **Conditions** for certain criteria to be met before a user can trigger this action.
4. For the Show User Profile action to work, user profiles must be enabled in your app’s privacy settings. You can do this by setting the app as private (users cannot access the app without signing in) or public with either required sign-in or optional sign-in. The action will not work in a public app with no sign-in required from anyone.

### In the Workflow Editor

3. Configure your first action by clicking the first action in the sequence. You can also add Conditions to your actions, if needed.
4. To add new actions to the flow, hover just underneath an action and click the plus button. In this way you can add the Show User Profile action as just one step in a larger workflow.
