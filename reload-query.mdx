# Reload Query

Refresh data from SQL sources.

### Reload Query - Block 1

The **Reload Query** action allows you to manually refresh queried data from a SQL [**data source**](/docs/essentials/data-sources). Changes made in the SQL database aren’t instantly synced in Glide, so the Reload Query action lets users manually refresh data when they make a change.

The action only appears in the action menu, either in the [**Layout Editor**](/docs/getting-started/intro-to-layout) or in the Action Editor, if you already have a SQL data source in your app.

## **Setting up the Reload Query Action**

### In the Layout Editor

2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and select **Reload query**.
3. Select the icon and descriptive text to use in your app.
4. Select the data source you want to refresh the data for.
5. Choose which table the action should reload the query from.
6. When used with some components, you can optionally add **Conditions **for certain criteria to be met before a user can trigger this action.

1. Select the **+ New Workflow **button. If you have existing actions, click on the plus (+) sign in the left panel.
2. Select the **data source** for your action.
3. Click the first step in the workflow to change it.
4. Search for the **Reload query** action.
5. You can also add conditions to your actions, if needed.
6. To add new actions to the flow, hover just underneath an action and click the plus button. In this way you can add the Reload Query action as just one step in a larger workflow.
