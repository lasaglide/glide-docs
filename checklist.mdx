# Checklist

Display a list of items as an interactive checklist.

### Checklist - Block 1

The **Checklist Component** is a special type of [**Collection Component**](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/essentials/components/collection-components) that allows you to display items in an interactive checklist. You can use this component to track progress on various things, such as your to do tasks, shopping items, or a step-by-step process frequently used in your business.
