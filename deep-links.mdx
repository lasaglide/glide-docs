# Deep Links

Link to different screens in your app with URLs.

### Deep Links Body Text

By default, all the screens in your app have the same URL, which makes it impossible to share a specific item in your app with someone.

However, if your table uses [Row IDs](/row-id-column), viewing a details screen will update the current URL, which is available as a value called **Link to current** screen.

You can **Copy this link to the clipboard**, send it to **Zapier**, or use the **Share** action to let your users easily share items in your app any way they'd like.

### Deep Links - Arcade 1

### [BLANK] Deep Links - Callout 1

Your [Google Sheet](/essentials/data-sources/google-sheets) needs a **Row ID column** for Deep Links to work.
