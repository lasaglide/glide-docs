# OpenAI Integration Setup

Setup an OpenAI integration with Glide

### OpenAI Integration Setup - Block 1

The **OpenAI integration** allows you to leverage the power of artificial intelligence with OpenAI's language models. These models have the ability to comprehend, produce, and interact with text and images.

### OpenAI Usage and Rate Limits

OpenAI [charges for API usage](https://openai.com/pricing) and has [variable rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits?context=tier-free). If you [exceed your quota](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6891831-error-code-429-you-exceeded-your-current-quota-please-check-your-plan-and-billing-details), you will get an error in Glide.
