Trigger IFTTT Applets using webhooks

### IFTTT Webhook - Block 1

[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) is an automation tool that connects various apps and services. With IFTTT's integration in Glide, you can trigger IFTTT Applets, allowing you to automate actions between Glide and other connected apps. Automations can make your app more powerful by streamlining your repetitive tasks.
