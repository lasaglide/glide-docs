# Text to Number

Transform text into numbers. 

### Text to Number Body Text 1

The **Text to Number** feature transforms a text input into a numerical output. It can convert emojis, basic math logic, phrases, and a variety of languages. It can also take instructions about your data and apply them to existing text, returning a number result. 



### Math in Text Columns

Large language models (LLMs) are generally not good at doing math when the input is pure text. Consider specifying in the instructions to “Do the given math equation.”

### Text to Number Body Text 3

1. Open the table where you want to use the **Text to Number** column.
2. Add a new basic text column for the **Input**. The input can be any column that contains text, so if you’ve used another action or computed column to create a text result, you can also use that text result as the **Input** source. - New columns added with the plus button will always appear on the right. If you'd like to add a column somewhere else in your data, you can select the dropdown menu on an existing column and choose **Add column right.** You can also click and drag columns to rearrange them.
3. Add a **Text to Number **column to store the result. Search for “Text to Number” or navigate to **AI → Text to Number**. 
4. For **Instructions,** enter custom text to create more specificity for your prompt.
5. For **Input **, use the **Input **column created previously. 
6. Adjust the display configurations for precision, group separator, and units if needed.
7. **Note:** If the action will be triggered in the Workflow Editor, then add a basic number **Result** column where the result will be stored.
8. Click on **Done**.

2. In the configuration panel on the right, in the **Actions** menu, select the **Text to Number** action.
3. Name the action and choose an icon.
4. For **Instructions,** enter custom text to create more specificity for your prompt.
5. For **Input**, choose the column where the text to be analyzed is stored, or enter custom text.
6. For **Results, **select the column where the results should be stored. 
7. To display the text that results from the action, add a [Text Component](/essentials/components/text) and use your results column as the source. This will instantly show the generated results to your users. 
8. To enable users to adjust the instructions, add a [Text Entry Component](/essentials/components/entry) pointing to an **Instructions** column with the adjustments you want made.
9. To enable users to adjust the input, add a [Text Entry Component](/essentials/components/entry) pointing to the **Input** column to be able to change the input.
