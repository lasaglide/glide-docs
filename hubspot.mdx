## Hubspot Objects and Properties

### Objects

The Hubspot integration in Glide currently supports integrations with 3 [Hubspot objects](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/get-started/manage-your-crm-database#understand-objects-records-and-properties):

1. **Contacts **- Individuals who interact with your business
2. **Companies **- Organizations your business engages with
3. **Deals **- Typically sales opportunities that are tracked in pipelines



### [BLANK] Hubspot - Warning 1

Each object has a unique identifier that is used to link records between Glide and Hubspot. Be sure to store this field in Glide if you want to retrieve info or make changes to records in the future.

### Hubspot - Block 3

### Properties

Once you pick an object and find its unique identifier, you’ll need the **Hubspot Property Internal Name** for the value(s) you want to add, edit, or retrieve.

1. [Properties](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/get-started/manage-your-crm-database#understand-objects-records-and-properties) are the different fields where you can store information. For example a Contact has properties like First Name, Last Name, Location, etc.
2. An Internal Name is the name of the field that does not change and is needed for integrations. For example, one day you may want to relabel First Name as Name in Hubspot, but the internal name (firstname) never changes.

To retrieve the internal name of a property:

1. In Hubspot, go to your **Settings.**
2. In **Data Management**, select the Object you are working with.
3. In Setup, select **Manage contact properties.**
4. Search and select the Property you want.
5. Select **</> **and copy the **Internal name.**

## Features

Glide supports 5 features for each of Hubspot’s objects.

1. **Create **- Adds a new record
2. **Edit **- Updates an existing record
3. **Archive **- Temporarily hides a record without permanently deleting it
4. **Delete **- Permanently removes a record
5. **Retrieve Info **- Displays properties from a record in Glide.

All 5 features can be added as [Actions](/actions) to [Components](/components) or added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor). Additionally, the **Retrieve Info** feature can be added as a [Computed Column.](/computed-columns)

### Hubspot Example 1

Let’s look at 3 examples of the Hubspot integration.

### Example 1: Create Contact

The Create Contact action creates a new Contact record in Hubspot with the property values you send from Glide.

You can customize which properties to add to the new contact record in Hubspot. Make sure you use your internal Hubspot names so the fields match when you send the new contact data.

When you create a new contact, Hubspot will send back a Contact ID to be stored in Glide. You can specify which column in Glide should store the Contact ID data.

### [BLANK] Hubspot - Callout 2

While not required, if you don’t fill out the “Values” field, a blank contact will be created in Hubspot.

### Hubspot - Block 4

### Example 2: Archive Company

The Archive Company action hides a company in Hubspot. You can specify a column that houses Hubspot Company IDs to automate this process.

### Example 3: Retrieve Deal Info

The Retrieve Deal Info action looks up a deal in Hubspot with the ID you provide and returns the property you request. You'll need a column with Deal IDs that match Hubspot, as well as the Property name from Hubspot.
