# Multiplayer

Collaborate with your team in real time on the same app.

### Multiplayer - Block 1

Multiplayer enables multiple people to work on the same Glide app at once. Before this feature, only one person could edit an app at a time. Now multiple users can work on the same app at the same time - building screens, adding features, and managing data.

### [BLANK] Multiplayer - Callout 1

The Multiplayer feature is currently in Beta. To use this feature, go to your team's **Settings** and enable it in the Preview panel.

### Multiplayer - Block 2

## **What you can do with Multiplayer Mode**

Multiple people can work on different parts of your app at the same time. For example, one person can build screens while another reviews data or tests user flows. You can also open the same app in multiple tabs to work more efficiently, like viewing data while working on the [Layout](/getting-started/intro-to-layout).

Each person's undo and redo actions only affect their own changes, so you won't accidentally undo someone else's work.

### [BLANK] Multiplayer - Callout 2

You won't see indicators showing when other team members are editing an app. Coordinate with your team to avoid conflicts.

### Multiplayer - Block 3

## **Publishing with Multiplayer Mode**



### Multiplayer - Block 4

When Publish manually is enabled, you need to manually publish your app to make changes live. With Multiplayer, manual publishing will publish all changes from everyone currently working in the app, not just your own changes. Make sure to check with your team before publishing to avoid going live with incomplete changes.

### Tip

Use [Visibility Conditions](/reference/user-experience/visibility-conditions) to hide work-in-progress screens or features from regular users while your team develops them. This lets you publish updates without exposing unfinished work.
