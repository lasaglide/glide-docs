# Show Edit Screen

Trigger the edit screen on a details screen.

### Show Edit Screen Body Text 1

The **Show Edit Screen** action allows you to prompt users to edit data on the current screen they're viewing.

The **Show Edit Screen** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [Collections](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows).

## **Setting up the Show Edit Screen Action**

### In the Layout Editor

1. Click on the plus (+) sign in the **Components **panel and select the **Component** you want to trigger the action.
2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and select **Show edit screen**.
3. Select the icon and descriptive text to use in your app.
4. In the **Data** field, select the screen which the user can edit. For the current screen, select **This item**.
5. In the **Navigation** field, select how the edit screen fields should appear: as the current screen, main screen, an overlay, or a slide in.
6. You can optionally add **Conditions** for certain criteria to be met before a user can trigger this action.
7. Once this is done, on the **Screen** (not the components panel), click on the component you selected to trigger the action. A **Form Container** will appear with the data from that row filled in, and the components panel will change to reflect the fields in this form.
8. Each component inside of your form container can also be customized. The options for customization will depend on what type of component you’re using. For every entry, you can decide if users will be required to fill it out.
9. You can allow users to edit all the information, or only some of the information in that row. If you want to restrict what data users can edit, remove the fields you don’t want them to edit from the components panel.

### In the Workflow Editor

1. Select the **+ New Workflow** button. If you have existing actions, click on the plus (+) sign in the left panel.
2. Select the **data source** for your action.
3. Configure your first action by clicking the first step in the workflow. You can also add conditions to your actions, if needed.
4. To add new actions to the flow, hover just underneath an action and click the plus button. In this way you can add the Show Edit Screen action as just one step in a larger workflow.
