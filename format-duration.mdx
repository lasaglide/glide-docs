1. In the [Data Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor), open the table you want to edit.

3. Name the column.
4. For **Type**, search for **Format Duration **or navigate to **Computed **→ **Experimental **→** Date & Time **→** Format Duration. **
5. For **Seconds**, enter a custom value or select a column from your [data source](/essentials/data-sources) that contains the value for the number of seconds you’d like to format.
6. For **Format**, enter a custom value, or select a column from your data source to use as the format style.
