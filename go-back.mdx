# Go Back

Move the user back to whatever screen they were on before.

### Go Back Body 1

The **Go Back** action works exactly like the back button in the corner of an app. It moves the user back to whatever screen they were on before.

The **Go Back** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [Collections](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow.](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows)
