# Card

Display a list of items in a card layout

### Card - Block 1

The **Card Component** is a special type of [Collection Component](/essentials/components/collection-components) that allows you to display items in a grid. It's a great choice when you want images to be the focus in your list like with collections of homes, products, or digital art. If you don’t want to include a border around the photo and the text, you may want to consider using the [Grid](/essentials/components/collections/grid) component.
