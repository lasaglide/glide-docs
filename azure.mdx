Access machine learning models with Azure AI

### Azure - Block 1

[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), a tool from Microsoft, provides out-of-the-box features to simplify app creation. One of these features is called Computer Vision, a powerful AI tool that explains what’s in an image. With the **Describe image** feature in Glide, you can have an image analyzed by Azure, and it will tell you what’s in the image.

## Features

The Azure integration in Glide currently supports one feature: **Describe image.**

### Describe image

The **Describe image** feature lets you send an image to Azure, and Azure will tell you what’s in the image. This can be added to a [Component](/components) that supports [Actions](/actions) or added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor).

To set it up, you'll need to create a column to house the Image URL, and a second column to house the image description you generate with Azure.
