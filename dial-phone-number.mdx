# Dial Phone Number

Trigger a phone call when tapped.

### Dial phone Number Body 1

The **Dial Phone Number** action allows you to trigger a phone call when an item is tapped. The **Dial Phone Number** action can be triggered from any device with phone capabilities.

The **Dial Phone Number** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [Collections](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows).

### Dial Phone Number Body 2

1. Click on the plus (+) sign in the **Components** panel and select the **Contact** or **Button ** component.
2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and select **Dial Phone Number**.
3. Select the icon and descriptive text to use in your app.
4. Enter the phone number to call when the user triggers the action. You can fill in a custom static number, or use the value from a column in your data.
5. You can optionally add **Conditions** for certain criteria to be met before a user can trigger this action.

If you select the contact component, Glide will automatically display options to dial a phone number, compose SMS, and compose email. To delete any of these options that you don’t need, click on the action and then click on the delete icon.

If you’d like to track other information, such as the date/time that a phone number was called from your app, you can create a custom action with multiple steps.

1. Select the **+ New Workflow **button. If you have existing workflows, click on the plus (+) sign in the left panel.
2. Select the **data source** for your action.
3. Configure your first action by clicking the first step in the sequence. You can also add conditions to your actions, if needed.
4. To add new actions to the flow, hover just underneath an action and click the plus button. In this way you can add the Dial Phone Number action as just one step in a larger workflow.
