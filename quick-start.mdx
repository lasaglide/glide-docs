Quick guide on creating and sharing custom apps with Glide.

### New to No Code?

### Quick Start - Block 1

With Glide, you can create an app and share it with users in minutes.

### Quick Start - Block 2

## Step 1: Copy a template

The fastest way to get up and running is to copy a template. You'll find the templates screen in the left sidebar of your Dashboard. From here, click on the link for the [Template Store](https://www.glideapps.com/templates) where you can browse and copy a template to get started. 

## Step 2. Customize

Start in the [App Settings](/app-settings) to find the different ways you can customize your app with a single click.

1. Change the accent color
2. Upload your own app Icon
3. Change the [Access Settings](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/getting-started/app-settings#access) of your app if you want other people to access it

## Step 3: Add the app to your home screen

In the top right of Glide, you'll see a button where you can publish your app. You can scan the QR code with your phone, text the link to yourself, or invite yourself to the app to receive a Magic Link. If you visit that link on your phone, you'll view your app in your phone's browser. From here, you can also add it to your home screen, just like a regular app. Check out this quick video to learn how.
