# CSV to JSON

Convert data from a CSV.

### CSV to JSON - Block 1

A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is a type of file used to store tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form. It's essentially a basic spreadsheet format without the additional formatting or formulas you'd find in something like a Glide Table, Google Sheet, Excel, or Airtable. CSV files are typically used for data import and export among different software programs.

The CSV integration provides tools to transform CSV data in Glide.

## Adding the Integration

To start using the CSV integration, you first need to add it to your project.

- In Glide, click the Settings icon in the upper-right corner.
- Navigate to the **Integrations** tab and select **CSV**
- Click the **Add** button

## Using CSV to JSON

The **CSV to JSON** feature converts CSV values into JSON values. It requires a CSV string value as the input, and will export JSON.

If you have a CSV file, you will first need to upload the file with a [file picker component](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/essentials/components/file-and-image-pickers), then parse the CSV data with the [Get Webpage Source](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/automation/integrations/browser) or [Call API](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/automation/integrations/call-api) feature. You can then use the parsed CSV values as the input for the CSV to JSON feature.

### In the Data Editor

1. Open the table where you want to use the **CSV to JSON** feature.
2. Add a new [URL column](/essentials/basic-columns/url) by clicking the (**+**) plus symbol to the right of the table. This will store the file URL for CSV files uploaded from the file picker component. - New columns added with the plus button will always appear on the right. If you'd like to add a column somewhere else in your data, you can select the dropdown menu on an existing column and choose **Add column right.**You can also click and drag columns to rearrange them.
3. Add a [Get Webpage Source](/automation/integrations/browser) column to parse the CSV values from the file. Search for “Get Webpage Source” or navigate to Integrations → Browser → Get Webpage Source. - The input for this column should be the URL column you created in step 2, with the CSV file URLs
- If you prefer to use a [Call API ](/automation/integrations/call-api)column, you can also use the **Get** method and make the endpoint your uploaded CSV file. This allows for added authentication via API if necessary.
4. Add a **CSV to JSON** column. Search for “CSV to JSON” or navigate to Integrations → CSV→ CSV to JSON.
5. For the **CSV string** field, use the Get Webpage Source or Call API column you created in step 3, or enter a custom CSV value string.
