# Make

Integrate 1600+ tools with your app.

### Make Video

### Make - Block 1

[**Make**](https://www.make.com/en/register?promo=glide-app-partner-program) is a platform that lets you design, build, and automate anything—from simple tasks to complex workflows—in minutes. With Make, you can send information between Glide and [thousands of apps](https://www.make.com/en/integrations?addOnApps=1&nativeApps=1&utm_source=glide-app&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=glide-app-partner-program) to enjoy enhanced team productivity and customer satisfaction.

This connection between Glide and Make can be used to send data out to Make from Glide via Trigger webhook, or to reach into Glide from Make with a scenario. If you want to make changes to data in Glide, then you’ll need to use the Make integration.

### Learn About Make

If you’re new to Make, we recommend checking out [Make Academy](https://academy.make.com/) before getting started.

### Make - Block 2

In order for Make to automate tasks, we have to first create a scenario. This is a series of steps (or modules) that tell how data from Glide should be transferred and transformed to any third party apps.

A basic scenario has two steps:

- a **Trigger**
- and an **Action**

Not sure where to start? Make has some prebuilt Glide integrations. [**Check them out here**](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/glide?utm_source=glide-app&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=glide-app-partner-program)**.**

The actions available via the Make integration are **Add Row, Delete Row, Edit Row, Get All Rows,** or **Get Row.** To use more than one of these actions, set up a unique scenario for each one.

## Adding the Integration



### Make Arcade - 1 (New)

### Make - Block 3

1. If you do not already have a [Make account](https://www.make.com/en) create one.
2. In Glide, click the **Settings** icon in the upper-right corner.
3. Navigate to the **Integrations** tab and then select Make.
4. Click the **Add **button.
5. The integration menu will now show a hidden **API Key.**
6. Select **Copy to Clipboard** when you’re ready to set up the Make scenario.

## Trigger Webhook with Make Connection

The [Trigger Webhook](/automation/actions/webhook) action can be used to send data to Make for any connection you’ve set up between Glide and Make. To create a Make connection with Trigger Webhook:

### Layout Editor



### Make - Arcade 2 (New)

### Make - Block 4

1. Click on the plus (**+**) sign in the **Components** panel to add a new component that supports actions, or select an existing component to add an action.
2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and search for **Trigger Webhook** or navigate to **Integrations → Trigger Webhook.**
3. Select the icon and title for your action.
4. Add the Make URL for the specific scenario you want to connect.
5. Add as many values as needed. No specific values are required.
6. Add conditions to the action, if desired. These will limit when the action is allowed to trigger.
7. Click away to save the configuration.

### Workflow Editor



### Make - Arcade 3 ( New)

### Make - Block 5

1. Select the (**+**) plus symbol or the **+ New Workflow** button.
2. Select as the data source for the action the data source of the screen where the action is triggered.
3. Search for **Trigger Webhook** or navigate to **Integrations → Trigger Webhook.**
4. Add the Make URL for the specific scenario you want to connect.
5. Add values to the request body as needed. These can be entered manually, or come from a column in your data.
6. Name the action.
7. Click away to save the configuration.

In the Workflow Editor, you can view the run history of the workflow. Clicking into any specific run and opening the **Data sent** window will show the JSON that was sent through the Make connection.

## Creating the Make Scenario

After you’ve connected the Make integration with the steps above, you can create a scenario. 

### Configuring the Trigger



### Make - Arcade 4 (New)

### Make - Block 6

1. In your Make dashboard, select **+ Create a new scenario**.
2. Click the large plus symbol and search for **Webhooks**.
3. Select **Custom webhook**.
4. Click **Create a webhook.**
5. Name your webhook.
6. Make will generate the webhook URL for you. Copy this URL for your Trigger Webhook action in Glide.

### Configuring the Make Action



### Make Arcade - 5

### Make - Block 7

1. In the same scenario you started above, select the plus to **add another module**.
2. Search for **Glide.**
3. Select which Action to perform: **Add Row, Delete Row, Edit Row, Get All Rows,** or **Get Row.**
4. Name the connection and enter the API key from your Glide app settings where you enabled the Make integration.
5. The configuration menu will show fields where you can select which **App, Table,** and **Row ID** to use for the scenario. These options will fill in automatically from Glide. - If you are using the **Edit Row** or **Delete Row** event, you’ll need to have a Row ID column in your Glide table and provide that column data in the Make configuration.
6. Fill in the values as needed. These can be columns from your data in Glide, or custom values entered manually.
7. Select **OK** to save your configuration.
