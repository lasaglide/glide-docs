Learn how to work with and adapt premade templates.

### Templates

### Templates - Block 1

Templates are brilliant for kick-starting your app. There are [hundreds in our store](https://www.glideapps.com/templates) for all types of use cases, and you can use them to get your apps closer to the finish line.

## Copying templates

Once you've found a template you like, you can copy it to your Glide account to make it your own. Here's how:

- Select the template you want to copy.
- Click on the **Create this app** button.
- If you're not already signed in to your Glide account, you'll be prompted to sign in or create an account.
- If you're new to Glide, the template will be copied to your default team folder. If you've already created multiple teams in Glide, you'll be prompted to select a team and the template will be copied here.

## Customizing templates

After copying a template, you'll want to customize its settings. You can get here by clicking the settings icon at the top of the [Layout Editor](/intro-to-layout).

Here are some suggestions for your first changes:

1. Under **Appearance**, you can customize the **Navigation **and **Accent Color.**
2. Click **Name & Icon **to upload your own logo or icon.
3. Click **Access **to change the privacy settings of your app.
4. When you're ready to share your app, click the **Publish **button in the top right of Glide
5. Customize your app's link, and invite users. Use the link or QR code to install your app and share it with the world!



### Templates - Block 2

## Creating templates

If you've created an app and you want to turn it into a template, you'll find this option in the app's dropdown menu on the dashboard. You can also click into your templates sub-folder and start a template from scratch there.

In fact, any of your team members can make a template. Your collaborators can then create new apps from that template to move more quickly. This can be useful if your team creates a lot of apps or if you want to standardize the apps it creates.

### Submitting templates to the Template Store

The Glide Template Store is a great way to monetize and share your templates with the world.

To submit your app to the Template Store:

- Review the [Template Store Guidelines](/template-store-guidelines) to ensure your template is appropriate.
- Click **Submit to store.**
- Complete the template submission form with all the necessary information.
- You'll get an email when your template is either approved or rejected. If your template is rejected, the email will typically share a reason why and suggestions for resubmission.



### [BLANK] Templates - Callout 2

If you'd like to charge users to download your template, you'll need to connect a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account before submitting the form.

### Templates - Block 3

### Sharing templates privately

If you prefer to share your templates with specific users and not publish them to the Template Store, you can send users a direct link to your template. When a user receives this link, they can preview and copy your template in the same way as they would from the Template Store.

To share your templates privately:

- Click the **Share** button at the top right of your template app.
- If your template app isn't published, you'll be prompted to publish it.
- Once published, copy the link and share it as you wish!



### [BLANK] Templates - Callout 3

When someone opens your template link, they'll immediately be able to copy your template to their Glide account and use it. 

Any modifications to your template won't affect templates users have already copied. They'll need to download the updated version to access your changes.
