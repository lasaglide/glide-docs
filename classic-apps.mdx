Legacy Classic Apps in Glide

### Classic Apps are deprecated

As of June 30, 2025, Classic Apps have been completely deprecated and are no longer accessible in the Glide builder. They cannot be recovered or reopened, so any apps not migrated before this date are permanently unavailable.

### Classic Apps Block 1

As of March 2023, our flagship product, previously referred to as Glide Pages, is now called **Apps,** becoming our officially supported and recommended product. Legacy mobile apps are now called **Classic Apps,** and can no longer be created. Existing Classic Apps will continue to function but do not receive updates from our product team.



### Classic Apps Block 2

## Context

Glide Pages launched late 2021 as a large-screen companion to Glide Apps. What we initially meant as two complementary products came into conflict as we noticed users struggle to choose one over the other. A year later, we decided to evolve Glide toward one unified solution for building beautiful, powerful, adaptive apps that work across any device or screen size.
