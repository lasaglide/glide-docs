# Go to Tab

Navigate the user to any tab in your app.

### Go to Tab Body 1

The **Go to Tab** action allows you to move the user to a specific tab in your app.

This is different from the [Show New Screen](/automation/actions/show-new-screen) action which allows you to link to a sheet and customize that screen however you like. With **Go to Tab**, you have to already have created a Tab so the action can move the user there.

The **Go to Tab** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [Collections](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows).
