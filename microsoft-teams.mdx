## Send message to Teams channel

The **Send message to Teams channel** action is used to post a message in a channel within your Microsoft team. Just tell Glide which channel to sent the message in and what the message text will be. You can send the same message every time, or set up a dynamic message by first creating a [Template Column](/template-column) in the [Data Editor](/introduction-to-the-data-editor).

The action can be added to a [Component](/components) that supports [Actions](/actions) (e.g., a [Button component](/button-components)), added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor), or after a [Form](/forms) is submitted.
