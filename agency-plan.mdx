# Agency Plan

A custom Glide plan, exclusively for Certified Experts.

### Agency Plan Block 1

The Agency plan is created with the Expert in mind by providing Experts the powerful features of the [Enterprise plan ](https://www.glideapps.com/pricing)with special Expert-Workflow features at a reduced price of $99/month billed annually, or $125/month billed monthly. This plan is intended for the Expert's own use and not to host client apps. Only one Agency plan is allowed per expert. 

## Key Features

The agency plan allows Experts to create new teams that have a 30 day free trial period without requiring a form of payment. If a form of payment is not added when the trial period ends, the plan will be downgraded to a free plan.

Teams generated by an Expert with the Agency plan are automatically enrolled in revenue sharing.

Teams with an agency plan receive priority support.

Apps on an Agency plan can be transferred to a team that's on a trial.

## Usage Quotas

The Agency plan has the following usage quotas:

- Unlimited published apps
- 50 editors (capped)
- 50 users (capped)
- 10,000 updates

Agency plans can enable unlimited usage updates at $.02 per update, but users cannot be exceeded without a conversation with the Glide Experts Team.

- Pass all [Glide Certifications](https://www.glideapps.com/certification)
