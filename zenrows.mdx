To start using the ZenRows integration, you first need to add it to your project. You will need a [ZenRows](https://www.zenrows.com/) account if you don’t already have one.

## Get Page Content Action

The **Get Page Content** action retrieves the HTML content from the webpage URL you provide using your connected ZenRows account. The action returns the complete HTML markup of that webpage, including all tags, attributes, and text that appears on that page. The action can also render JavaScript on web pages to capture dynamically loaded content.

The action can be added to a column in the [Data Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor), a [Component](/essentials/components) that supports [Actions](/getting-started/introduction-to-actions) (e.g., a [Button component](/essentials/components/button)), or added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor).
