# Scan Barcode or QR Code

Scan barcodes or QR codes and log the values to your table.

### Barcode Scan Action

### Scan Barcode - Block 1

The **Scan Barcode or QR Code** action allows users to scan barcode and QR codes with your app and store the scanned values directly in your data. It can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button) and [Collections](/essentials/components/collection-components)) or triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow.](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows)

If you want to scan many barcodes one right after the other, we recommend the [Scanner component,](/essentials/components/scanner) which keeps the user’s camera on and ready to scan. Each scan will use 5 updates.

### [BLANK] Scan Barcode - Callout 1

The Scan Barcode and QR Code action is available for customers with Business and Enterprise plans. [Browse our plans to find the right fit for you.](https://www.glideapps.com/pricing)
