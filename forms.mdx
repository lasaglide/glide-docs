# Forms

Collect data from your users in customizable forms.

### Forms Body Text 1

Forms enable you to collect data from your app users, then incorporate that data into your larger database where you can use it for whatever you need. In Glide you can build forms specific to your needs, and you can create form screens in your apps. 

## Adding Form Screens

You can always build form screens from scratch, but Glide also has template screens you can use to get started. In the Layout Editor, select the plus icon next to **Navigation** in the left-hand panel. 

### Form Screen

**Form Screen **will open a window where you can select which table to target with the form, and which columns to include. The target table is where the form responses will be stored, and you can select as many or as few columns to include in the form as needed. You can also add new columns to include in the form directly from this screen.

After selecting **Create form**, the new screen will appear in the Layout Editor. Here you can customize each component, rearrange the form fields, and more.

### Multi-step form

You can also use a sample screen to create a multi-step form, which questions separated onto different pages. To use this sample screen, select the plus icon next to **Navigation **in the left-hand menu and select **Multi-step form**. This will import the sample screen directly into the Layout Editor in your app. 

The sample screen is made up of several form containers: one for each step. To customize the form fields, click into the component you want to change and configure it as needed. You can add more steps, remove steps, change which information is collected on each page, and make any other adjustments you need.

## Form Container Component

The **Form Container** component allows you to collect information from your users and store it directly in your app’s data. 

### Adding and Setting Up a Form Container

1. In the [Layout Editor](/intro-to-layout), select the tab you want to edit.
2. Click on the plus (+) symbol in the [Components](/components) panel.
3. Find **Forms** in the menu and select **Form Container**.
4. The container will automatically guess which table to add your form submissions to. To change this, select the form container and choose a different **Target table **on the right of the Layout Editor.** **
5. The form container will create fields based on the **Target table**. You can add or remove these fields as needed. 
6. Choose a background for your form if desired.
7. Decide what [Action](/getting-started/introduction-to-actions) should trigger when a user submits the form. By default, the action will show a notification that says “Success.” You can use any action here, or trigger an integration as part of a larger workflow. 
8. Each component inside of your form container can also be customized. The options for customization will depend on what type of component you’re using. For every entry, you can decide if users will be required to fill it out. 
9. Select as many **Form Elements **as you need and customize each one to create a comprehensive form for your needs.
