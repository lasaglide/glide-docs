# Glide Tables

Use Glide's built-in spreadsheet for optimal integration

### 25,000 Row Limit on Spreadsheet Data Sources

Rows from spreadsheet data sources have a **total cap of 25,000 rows across all tables**. If you need more than 25,000 rows of data in a team, consider a high-scale data source like [Big Tables.](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/essentials/data-sources/big-tables) 

### Glide tables - Block 1

Glide Tables are spreadsheets that live in Glide and are the most compatible data source for Glide apps. You can share Glide Tables among apps using the **Link Table** feature. Making changes in Glide Tables does not consume [updates](/reference/account/updates), unless you make changes through [Glide API](/essentials/data-sources/getting-started-with-the-glide-api) or have an Enterprise plan.

## How to create an app with Glide Tables

When you create a new app, Glide sets Glide Tables as the data source by default unless you select a different source.

3. You can add multiple cells of data at one time by copying cells from another data source and pasting the data into your Glide Table.
4. To add a row, select the plus icon located under the bottom row.
5. To add a column, select the plus icon located add the top right of the data table.

Glide converts your data file into a Glide Table and adds it to the list of tables available in your app's Data Editor.

## Link an existing Glide Table to your app

To share information across apps in the same team, you can use Glide's **Link Table** feature. When you link a table from one app to another, any changes made to that table's data will also be reflected in your other apps that use the same table.
