# Trigger Workflow

Trigger workflows with an action.

### Feature Still in Development

This feature has not yet reached [General Availability](/reference/account/preview-features), so it will likely continue to change as the Glide team makes improvements. This document will be updated as the feature becomes finalized.

### Trigger Workflow

The **Trigger Workflow** action triggers an existing workflow in your app. The action can be attached to a component that supports actions in the [Layout Editor,](/getting-started/intro-to-layout#layout-editor) or as an action step in any workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor). [Manually triggered workflows](/automation/workflows/manual) require this action to be triggered, but it can be paired with other workflow types as well. **Note: The Trigger Workflow action cannot trigger an app interaction workflow.**

When you use the Trigger Workflow action to trigger a workflow that can hold values (such as [Email](/automation/workflows/email-trigger), [Webhook](/automation/workflows/webhook), or [Slack](/automation/workflows/slack-trigger) workflows), you can also select values to pass through to the workflow when triggered.
