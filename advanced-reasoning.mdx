# Advanced Reasoning

Generate text with advanced reasoning.

### Advanced Reasoning - Block 1

The **Advanced Reasoning** feature uses OpenAI's most advanced o1-mini model to generate responses by thinking through problems step by step based on your instructions.

### [BLANK] Advanced Reasoning - Callout 1

Advanced reasoning is when AI thinks through problems step-by-step rather than just generating text based on patterns. [Learn more about Reasoning Models in this OpenAI doc.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning?api-mode=responses)
