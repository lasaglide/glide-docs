[The Glide Community](https://community.glideapps.com/) is a great way to request help and support for your existing apps. The forum is made up of thousands of users, many of whom are Glide experts. It is active and friendly, and members will be eager to help you there.

### Glide Community tips

1. Be polite and kind to other members.
2. Use the search bar to see if your topic has been discussed before.
3. Check out the community's different [categories](https://community.glideapps.com/categories).
4. When posting questions, try to be clear and concise and write descriptive titles. If you need help with many different things, try posting them as separate topics or connect with a [Glide Expert](https://glideapps.com/experts).
5. Where possible, provide links (e.g. to your app), screenshots or even [videos](https://www.loom.com/) that help explain the point you are trying to make.
6. Please be aware that everything you post in the forums is public.

## Support

Glide provides support for all paid plans through the Builder. To contact support, navigate to the team or app you need help with and click the chat icon in the bottom right corner. This will open the Messenger, where you can start a conversation with the team by clicking** Start a conversation**. Glide's AI agent will attempt to answer your question. If you still need help and have a Maker, Business, or Enterprise plan, click **Get more help** and provide additional details. A support agent will get back to you as quickly as possible.

You can also use the Messenger to access all your past conversations by clicking **Messages**, view Glide’s latest announcements by clicking **News**, and search through help articles by clicking the **Help** icon.

### Support - Block 2

Free plans are supported by visiting our [Community Forum](https://community.glideapps.com/) or the [Help Center](https://help.glideapps.com/en/). 

### Support's access to your data

When support reviews your app, they do so in a read-only environment. They can view the entire app and all the data visible in the Data Editor. While support can make local changes to the app and data on their end for troubleshooting purposes, these changes are not saved and do not affect your actual app.

Furthermore, support does not have access to any third-party data sources (e.g., Google Sheets) connected to your app, although they can see the data displayed in the [Data Editor](/introduction-to-the-data-editor).

We maintain a complete record of every instance when support accesses your app.

## Learning resources

Glide does not offer one-on-one support for building your app. However, we provide a comprehensive library of resources to guide you through the app-building process. If you need hands-on assistance, you can consult with Glide Experts, who are recognized for their proficiency with Glide. [You can find a list of these independent experts here](https://glideapps.com/experts).
