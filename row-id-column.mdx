Generate unique IDs for your rows.

To keep track of each row and its associated data while you and your users make changes in your app, you need to create a [Unique Identifier](/unique-identifier) for each row. Glide can add a unique ID to each row in your data source with the Row ID column. Although some row values, such as a person's email, may be unique, the most reliable method is to use a key or a unique ID for each row. 

To learn more about what a key is and how it relates to your data, see [Keys and Unique ID](/keys-and-unique-ids).

When new rows are added through forms or workflow, you can use the Unique Identifier component. The Unique Identifier gives you additional control over relations between items in your app. For a more detailed explanation, see [Unique Identifier](/unique-identifier).

## How to Add a Row ID column

1. In the [Data Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor), open the table you want to edit.
2. Add a new column by clicking the plus (**+**) symbol to the right of the table.- New columns added with the plus button will always appear on the right. If you'd like to add a column somewhere else in your data, you can select the dropdown menu on an existing column and choose **Add column right. **You can also click and drag columns to rearrange them.
3. Give the column a name.
4. For **Type**, search for **Row ID **or navigate to **Basic → Row ID. **Note that you can only have one Row ID column per table, so if you already have one, this option will be greyed out. 
5. Glide sets the new column's **Name** and **Type** as Row ID. Confirm these by selecting **Done.**

Glide generates a unique key for each row and adds the new Row ID column to your table. The lock icon in the column reminds you not to make changes to this column. You can move the Row ID column anywhere in your table and it will still work.

When you add, delete, or re-order rows in your sheet, Glide will maintain the Row ID column and make sure each row keeps its unique ID key.
