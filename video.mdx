The Video component displays videos in your app from platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo, Loom, and more. To display a video in your app, you just need a video's URL.

4. Add the link to your video, or choose a column with video links from your [Data Source](/data-sources). When entering a custom URL, only the share link is required. No embed link is necessary. 
5. Customize the aspect ratio and choose whether to show controls on the video
6. You can also choose to save progress to your data table. 

## Video Hosting

It's important to choose a video hosting or streaming service to store your videos, such as YouTube, Vimeo, Loom, etc. Hosting videos for the Video Component in Glide Tables or on Google Drive isn't advised. Neither of those cloud storage locations is a video streaming service and may be unreliable. 

If you upload video directly to Glide, there is a file size limit of 1 GB.
