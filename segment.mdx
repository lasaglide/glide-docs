## Using the Track Event Action



### Analytics Events Only Work in Live Apps

Tracking custom events only works in live apps when triggered by a user. Note that when testing in the Glide builder, the action will not track data. 

### Segment - Arcade 2

### Segment - Block 4

The **Track event** action sends an analytics event to your Segment workspace. After naming an event, you can add values to track in Segment.

The action can be added to a [**Component**](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/components) that supports Actions (e.g., a [**Button component**](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/button-components)), added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor), or after a [**Form**](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/forms) is submitted.

1. Click on the plus (**+**) sign in the **Components** panel to add a new component that supports actions, or select an existing component to add an action.
2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and search for **Track event** or navigate to **Integrations → Segment → Track event.**
3. Select the icon and title for your action.
4. Create an **Event name.**
5. Add the values you'd like to sent to Segment.
6. Click away to save and exit the configuration.
