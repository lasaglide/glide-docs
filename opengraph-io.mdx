# OpenGraph.io

Fetch metadata from any URL.

### OpenGraph.io - Block 1

[OpenGraph.io](http://opengraph.io/) provides a set of tools and APIs for generating rich previews of links on the web. With it, you can fetch metadata from any URL and incorporate that data into your Glide app.

## Get Website Metadata Action

The **Get Website Metadata Action** will fetch metadata from a website URL using your connected OpenGraph.io account. The action can be added to a column in the [Data Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor), a [component](/essentials/components) that supports [Actions](/getting-started/introduction-to-actions) (e.g., a [Button component](/essentials/components/button)), or added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor).

The action can gather the following data from a URL:

- **Result**: The full metadata fetched from OpenGraph as JSON
- **Title:** The webpage title
- **Description:** The description of the webpage
- **Type:** The type of content on the page
- **Image URL:** The main image URL for the page
- **URL:** The canonical URL of the page
- **Favicon URL:** The Favicon URL for the page
- **Site Name:** The name of the website
- **Published Time:** When the article was published, if the content type is an article
- **Author URL:** URL to the article author’s profile, if the content type is an article

### Advanced options

There are three advanced options that can be enabled for each iteration of the **Get Website Metadata** action.

**Allow cache** will cache the retrieved metadata in OpenGraph.io’s servers. By default this cache will be stored for five days.

**Full Render** will return the full HTML of the page.

**Use Proxy** will route the request through one of OpenGraph.io’s proxy servers.

**Accept Language** by default metadata will be retuned in English, but this can be changed if you prefer to retrieve data in another language.
