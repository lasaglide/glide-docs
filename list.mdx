# List

 Display a group of items in a list layout.

### List - Block 1

The **List Component** is a special type of [**Collection Component**](/docs/essentials/components/collection-components) that allows you to display items in a list. You can use this layout when your primary focus is displaying data, especially when images are not available or necessary.

3. Choose what [**Data Source**](/docs/essentials/data-sources) it should use.
4. Give the collection a **Title**.
5. Customize your collection with **Data** and **Design**.
6. Choose if you'd like to limit the number of items that appear, as well as how many items to show per page.

You can add [**Actions**](/docs/getting-started/introduction-to-actions) to your List Collection to allow users to interact with your data.

2. Choose **Enable advanced actions.**
3. Choose where to add the action.
4. Choose from our menu of actions, or create your own custom action.
5. Take your new action for a test run!
