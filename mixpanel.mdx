## Track custom event

The **Track custom event **action is used to send an analytics event to your Mixpanel project. After naming the event, you can add values to track in Mixpanel.

The action can be added to a [Component](/components) that supports Actions (e.g., a [Button component](/button-components)), added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor), or after a [Form](/forms) is submitted.

### Analytics Events Only Work in Live Apps

Tracking custom events only works in live apps when triggered by a user. Note that when testing in the Glide builder, the action will not track data.
