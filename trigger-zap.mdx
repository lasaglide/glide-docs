# Trigger Zap

Send values from your Glide app to Zapier.

### Trigger Zap Action Deprecated

The Trigger Zap action was deprecated in December 2023. Existing actions will continue to work, but new ones cannot be created. Users who want to integrate with Zapier should use the [Trigger Webhook](/automation/actions/webhook) action with the [Zapier integration](/automation/integrations/zapier) instead. Classic Apps can still create new Trigger Zap actions.

Zapier allows you to connect different apps and automate the work you do. The **Trigger Zap action **lets you send values from your app to any application you can find in the [Zapier Directory](https://zapier.com/apps).

The Trigger Zap action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [**Collections**](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [**Custom Action**](/getting-started/introduction-to-actions).

For example, the app below shows a Zap that automatically sends an email to the interview candidate inviting them for a second interview—all with a single tap of a [Button](/essentials/components/button)!

## **Setting up the Trigger Zap Action**

Before you set up the action in Glide, you need to create the Zap in Zapier. For detailed instructions on how to integrate and create Zaps with Zapier, read our full guide [**here**](/automation/integrations/zapier) before proceeding.

Once you’ve connected your Glide account with Zapier and created your Zap, you can continue either in the [Layout Editor](/getting-started/intro-to-layout) or in the [Action Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-actions).
