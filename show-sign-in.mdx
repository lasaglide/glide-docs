# Show Sign In

Show the sign in screen on your app.

### Sign In Body Text 1

The **Sign In** action will pull up the sign in screen for the user.

For the Sign in action to work, your [app's privacy settings](/getting-started/app-settings#access) must be set to Public, with either optional or required sign-in, where Anyone can create a profile. The sign-in action will only appear if the user is not signed in yet.

The **Sign In** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [Collections](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows).

## **Setting up the Sign In Action**
