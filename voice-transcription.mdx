# Voice Transcription

Record and convert spoken words to text automatically.

### Voice Transcription - Block 1

The **Voice Transcription** component allows users to record audio and create text transcriptions instantly. This can be useful for field inspections, incident reports, customer interviews, or documenting operational procedures on the go.

Unlike the standalone [Record and Transcribe Voice](/automation/actions/record-and-transcribe-voice) action, this component comes with the action already configured and ready to use in your app.

## Setting up the Voice Transcription Component

When you add a Voice Transcription component in Glide it will automatically choose a column from your data to store the transcribed text. The component will also automatically set the component title to “Record voice” and the hint text to “Record or type.” These configurations can all be changed by editing the component settings on the right-hand side.

### In the Layout Editor

7. Change the **Placeholder** text for the transcription area.
