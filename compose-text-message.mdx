# Compose Text Message

Trigger a text message on the user's device.

### Compose SMS Body 1

The **Compose SMS** action allows you to trigger a new text message when the item is tapped.

The **Compose SMS** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [**Collections**](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows).

1. Click on the plus (+) sign in the **Components** panel and select the **Contact** or **Button ** component.
2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and select **Compose SMS**.
3. Select the icon and descriptive text to use in your app.
4. Choose the values to add to the draft SMS. Each field can be filled in with a custom static value, or with dynamic values from a column in your data. The fields you can add values to are:- **Phone number:** The number you want to send the SMS to.
- **Message:** The body text of the SMS.
5. You can optionally add **Conditions** for certain criteria to be met before a user can trigger this action.

If you select the contact component, Glide will automatically display options to dial a phone number, compose SMS, and compose email. To delete any of these options that you don’t need, click on the action and then click on the delete icon.
