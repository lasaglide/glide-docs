# Calendar

Display items on a calendar based on a specified date and time.

### Calendar - Block 1

The Calendar component is a special type of [Collection Component](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/essentials/components/collection-components) that allows you to display items on a calendar based on a specified date and time. You can use this component to display events, appointments, deadlines, and more on a calendar.

The Calendar component has different views to show events in different formats. You can display events by month, week, day, or display an agenda view.

## Setting Up Calendar Collections

To set up your Calendar Collection:

1. In the [Layout Editor](/intro-to-layout) of your app, hit the plus (+) symbol to add a new component.
2. Find **Collections** in the menu and select **Calendar**.
3. Choose the [Data Source](/data-sources) where your calendar items are stored.
4. You can also give your calendar a new **Title** if you want.
