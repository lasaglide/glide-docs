# Sign-In Screen

Customize your app's sign-in screen.

### Sign-in screen body 1

If your app uses any kind of sign-in method, you can customize your sign-in screen's appearance by uploading your own background, logo, greeting, and description.

## Default sign-in screen

Your sign-in screen will default to the settings configured in the Appearance settings. To start customizing your sign-in screen visit **Settings -> Sign-In Screen**. Here you can customize the background, add a logo, and change the Greeting text and description.

## Text

You can change the greeting and the description in the **Text** section. The colors you've set under **Appearance **settings will also apply to the sign-in screen, so if need to adjust the contrast between the background and the text, you can do so from there.
