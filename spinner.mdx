# Spinner

Display a loading indicator while data is being processed.

### Spinner - Block 1

The **Spinner** component shows a loading animation to indicate that an action or workflow is in progress, which helps improve user experience by providing visual feedback during operations that might take time to complete.

## **Setting up the Spinner component**



### Spinner - Arcade 1

### Spinner - Block 2

1. In the **Layout Editor**, select the screen you want to edit.
2. Click on the plus (+) symbol in the **Components** panel.
3. Select the **Spinner** component.
4. Configure when the spinner should appear by setting visibility conditions.
5. Customize the spinner's appearance with size options (Small, Medium, or Large).

## Configuring Visibility for Spinners

Using **Spinners **with [Actions](/getting-started/introduction-to-actions) and [Workflows](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows), you can show the spinner when:

- Fetching data from external sources
- Processing large amounts of information
- Waiting for a workflow to complete
- Uploading or downloading files

To make sure the spinner shows when these conditions are met, make sure the visibility conditions are set in the **Options **tab of the component configuration menu. Here you can set the component to show or hide only when certain conditions are met. For example, if you want users to see the spinner only until the last step of a workflow has completed, then set the visibility to show the component only once the data reflects that last step of the workflow has processed.
