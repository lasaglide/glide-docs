# Collections

Show lists of items from your tables in different layouts.

### Collections Body Text

**Collections** turn your data into powerful functions of your app. They can be configured in many different ways, connected to [Actions](/actions) and workflows, customized with different styles and designs, and more.

## Adding and Setting Up Collections

### Data

Choose a Table or Relation for your Collection's [Data Source.](/data-sources/) You can also give your collection a **Title** to provide more direction for your users.

### Style

Most collections like **Card**, **List**, **Grid**, and **Table** are roughly the same in how they are configured. Some collections have very different configurations, so please refer to their specific documentation ([Kanban Board](/kanban-collection)**, **[Calendar](/calendar)**,** and [Data Grid](/data-grid-collection)).

### Items Data

For most styles, you have the option to show a **Title**, **Subtitle**, **Meta**, and **Image**.

### Design

Depending on the Style you’ve chosen, your Design options may vary. Typically, you’ll have options to select the **Style**, **Size**, and **Alignment**. Configure any additional design options to further customize how your Collection component is displayed.

### Options

You can limit the number of items in your Collection, which shortens it to the specified number. But you can also customize the **Page size**. In other words, if the Collection is very long, it will automatically be grouped into pages and you can click through to the next or previous page.

You can choose how many items appear on a page, which will affect the overall height of your collection.

## Enable Options settings

You can customize the data displayed in your Collection by using [**Conditions**](/conditions-filtering-and-visibility) and other options.

### Visibility

You can define when your Collection will be displayed by creating specific conditions to be met. In the **Visibility** section, click the **Add Condition** button to create your conditions.

### Filter data

You can limit the items displayed in your Collection based on their properties. In the **Filter Data** section, click the **Add Filter** button to create your filters.

### Sort data

By default, Collection items appear in the same order as they are in the data source. However, you can customize the Collection’s sort in many ways. In the **Sort** section, click on the **Sort by Sheet order** field to expand the options and configure it.

### Group data

You can group the data in your Collection based on a specific column in your source. In the **Group** section, click on the **Group by** dropdown to choose the column to group your items by. Select the long dash option from the dropdown if you don’t want to group your Collection items.

### Search

In the **Search** section, enable the **Show search bar** option to allow users to search for specific items in the Collection.

### Filter

Select a filter in the **Show filter** field to let users filter the data that is displayed in the Collection. For example, you can configure a filter to limit the pins on a map based on a specific column in your data source.

## Actions

Click **Actions** to adjust the default actions to your collection or **Enable advanced actions** to customize different areas of your collection. If you choose to enable advanced actions, you can:

- Add **Title Bar Actions**, which creates buttons at the top of your collection.
- Add an **Item Click **action, which creates a single action that triggers when an item is clicked.
- Add **Collection Item Actions**, which creates buttons within each collection item.
