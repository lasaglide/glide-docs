# Signature

Let users add signatures to your app.

### Paid Plan Required

Access to this component requires a paid plan. [Review our plans to find the right fit for you](https://www.glideapps.com/pricing). 

### Signature Body Text 1

With the **Signature** component, you can let users sign for things in your app. When someone adds their signature, the Signature component generates an image and writes the link to that image to your app's [Data Source](/data-sources). It will then display their signature in the component.

## Signature Components in Forms

The Signature component is particularly useful in [Forms](/forms). Bear in mind that the signature will not write to the sheet until the form is submitted.
