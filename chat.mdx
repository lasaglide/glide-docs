# Chat

Allow users to chat with each other directly in your app. 

### Chat - Block 1

The **Chat Collection** is a special type of [**Collection Component**](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/collection-components) that allows users to chat with each other directly in your app. Users can send and receive chat messages instantly in a shared chat screen.

## **Configuring Chat Collections**

### Chat - Block 3

Chat collections are specifically designed for chat threads with the following **Display** fields:

- **Text**: The user’s chat text.
- **Timestamp**: The date and time the chat was sent.
- **User photo**: The photo of the user who sent the chat.
- **User name**: The name of the user who sent the chat.

After mapping the fields you want to display with columns in the data source, populate **Additional Columns** for each new message. This will store the values that you want to display in the data source.

- **Timestamp**: The date and time the chat was sent.
- **User photo**: The photo of the user who sent the chat.
- **User name**: The name of the user who sent the chat.
- **{A Unique Identifier}**: We recommend storing at least one unique value for the thread in which you want this chat to appear. This will allow you to set up a [**Relation**](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/relations) or [**Filter**](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/filter) to segment your chats.

In addition to the standard options available with collections, the chat collection also comes with an **Empty screen** option. This is the message that will be displayed when there are no previous chats to show.

Optionally, you can limit the number of chats that will appear on a page.
