# Boolean

Capture and store true or false values.

### Boolean - Arcade 1

### Boolean - Block 1

**Boolean** is a data type with two available values: true or false. You can use this to capture responses where only one of two opposing options is possible, such as:

- “Yes/No” to an RSVP
- “Pass/Fail” for an exam
- “In stock/Out of stock” for inventory items
- “Sold out/Available” for event tickets

When you add a Boolean column in the [Data Editor](/docs/essentials/data-sources), Glide will create a checkbox in that column in your table. The box will be unchecked if the value is false, and checked if the value is true.

To capture the true or false value in Glide, you can use the [**Switch or Checkbox Components**](/docs/essentials/components/checkbox-and-switches) from the Layout Editor. You can switch between the two at any time in the component’s **Design** option in the right side panel.
