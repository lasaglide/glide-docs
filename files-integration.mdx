# Files Integration

Create and Store files in Glide storage.

### Files - Block 1

The Files integration allows you to save files directly to Glide storage. This is useful for files that come from APIs and integrations like OpenAI and Replicate and may not be stored in Glide by default.

## Adding the Integration

## **Upload File**

Before configuring actions, you need to create two basic columns (text or URL) in the data editor: one to store the original file link and another to store the Glide file link.
