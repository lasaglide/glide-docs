### Google Analytics Intro

[Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics) is an analytics service offered by Google for web and mobile traffic and event tracking. You can use the Google Analytics integration to track app traffic, as well as custom events that you create and configure with your app.

In Google Analytics, everything is structured into accounts, properties, and data streams. **Accounts**, which are distinct from your Google or even Google Analytics account, typically represent a company. If you're affiliated with multiple organizations, you might have access to several of these accounts. Within these accounts are **properties**. These can be numerous, and they symbolize the various websites and apps tied to that business. **Data streams,** whether they are apps or websites, are what feed data into a property. A property can be seen as a team, department, or project within the company. A single property can comfortably house multiple data streams, thereby letting you monitor user activity across both websites and apps seamlessly.

### Google Analytics Stream Creation Arcade

### Google Analytics Dash Setup

Let's set up a basic data stream: A Glide app, connecting to a property in an Analytics account. If you haven't set up an account yet, sign up at [analytics.google.com](http://analytics.google.com/). For existing account holders, navigate to the admin area of Google Analytics.

1. If you have not already created an **Account **for the organization, create one in the Google Analytics dashboard. 
2. Create a **Property **and fill out the details you want to include with it. 
3. Choose a business description, size, and objective. 
4. Set up your **Data stream **in  the collection data section. Glide apps are web-based, so choose **web **as the data stream type. 
5. Add the URL for your live app and name the data stream.- Glide supports SSL
6. Click on the data stream you created to copy the **measurement ID **and paste this in Glide.

Once the measurement ID is connected to Glide, Google Analytics will start tracking user information and behavior and populating your dashboard with the data.
