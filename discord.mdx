# Discord

Send messages to your Discord server.

### Discord - Block 1

[Discord](https://discord.com/) is an instant messaging and voice call platform similar to [Slack](/slack) or [Microsoft Teams](/microsoft-teams). With the Discord integration, you can send messages to channels in your Discord server from a Glide app.

### Discord - Block 3

The **Send message to channel** action can send a message to your Discord server. To use it, a Channel ID for the Discord channel where the message should be sent is required. You will also need to include message text, which you can enter manually as a custom value or pull from a column in your data. 

### Looking for the Channel ID?
