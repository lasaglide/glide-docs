# Yelp

Access robust business information and hours of operation from Yelp.

### Yelp -Block 1

[Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/) allows you to access robust business data. You can display contact information, overall rating, review counts, and much more. By integrating Yelp with Glide Apps, you can create a powerful platform that leverages Yelp's data to provide users with a rich and engaging experience.

## Features

The Yelp integration in Glide has two features:

1. Find Business
2. Get Business Hours

### Find Business

The **Find Business** feature can be used to generate information about a business. This feature can be added as an [Action](/actions) (on a [Component](/components) that supports actions) or added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor). You can also create [Computed Columns](/computed-columns) to generate results directly in the [Data Editor](/data-editor).

To find a business, you need to provide either the coordinates of the business in latitude and longitude, or the full physical address of the business. 

The integration will then return and store whichever results you choose. The options are: business name, Yelp rating, business phone number with no dashes, business ID, alias, image URL (the URL of the hero image on the business's page), whether the business is closed, URL (a link to the business's yelp page), review count, category, price, and display phone number with dashes. 

### Yelp get Business hours

### Yelp - Block 3

### Get Business Hours

The **Get Business Hours **feature can be used to get the operating hours for a business. Just like the Find Business feature, you can use this feature as an Action, or you can create Computed Columns to generate business hours directly in the Glide Data Editor.

To use the feature, provide the business ID from yelp. This can be found in the yelp URL after the /biz: www.yelp.com/biz/**[business-id]. **The feature will return the hours for the business, as posted on yelp.
