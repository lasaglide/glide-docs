# Agent

Start building your Glide app by describing your needs.

### Agent - Intro

Glide Agent lets you build apps by describing what you want in a chat box. Based on what you tell it, Agent will create the foundation for your app using Glide's existing components and data tables. You can import your own data, or ask Agent to generate sample data tables for you.

Agent is in Beta and currently only available for users with new accounts. It has limitations and might make mistakes.

### Agent - Block 1

Users can access the Agent in three places:

**On Glide's main website: **When you start building with Agent on the homepage with a new account, it will create a new team and an app in that team.

**Inside Glide Teams: **If you start building using the chat box in a team, Agent will create a new app within that team or inside the folder where you started the prompt.

**In the Builder:** You can access Agent from the top navigation bar or the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to make changes to your existing app.

## What can Agent do

Agent can generate sample data tables including images, or build tables from your own data. It uses Glide's [Components](/essentials/components) like [Collections](/essentials/components/collections), [Forms](/use-cases/forms), and [Buttons](/essentials/components/button) to create interfaces that follow Glide’s design system, so your app looks consistent and professional. You can upload Excel files and CSVs, and Agent will integrate them into your app. Agent can also answer questions about how to use Glide, and help you brainstorm ideas for your app. 

## Prompting

Clear instructions help Agent understand exactly what you want to build.

### Agent - Block 2

## Customizing the app Agent builds

Once Agent builds your app, you can switch between Agent and the [Data Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor), [Layout Editor](/getting-started/intro-to-layout#layout-editor), and [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows) to customize it however you want. You can always go back to Agent to update your app or switch between any of the editors as you build.

## Limitations

Agent is a powerful starting point to build your app, but it has a few limitations as it’s still in early development:

- It can't set up workflows or automations yet.
- It can’t change advanced settings or permissions.
- It can't import large data files or perform advanced data transformations like bulk edits or custom calculations.
- It can’t access external APIs or integrate with other platforms directly yet.
