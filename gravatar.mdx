# Gravatar

Add Gravatars to user profiles.

### Gravatar - Block 1

[**Gravatar**](https://gravatar.com/) is a service that allows people to create a profile associated with an email address. Users can add a photo, or avatar, to their profile. When users create an account with a service that uses Gravatar, their photo is automatically populated in that service.

## **Adding and Configuring the Integration**

### Gravatar - Block 2

1. The **Gravatar** integration works like a column in your [**data source**](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/essentials/data-sources). In the [**Data Editor**](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor), choose the table where you want to add the Gravatar column. This will be most likely be your [**User Profile**](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/essentials/security-and-user-data/user-profiles) table.
2. Add a new column by clicking the plus (**+**) symbol to the right of the table.- New columns added with the plus button will always appear on the right. If you'd like to add a column somewhere else in your data, you can select the dropdown menu on an existing column and choose **Add column right.** You can also click and drag columns to rearrange them.
3. Name the column.
4. For **Type**, search for **Gravatar** or navigate to **Integrations -> Gravatar -> Get gravatar icon**.
5. Configure the **Data** options with the column that contains the email addresses for your users. Since a Gravatar profile is associated with an email address, this is required and can’t be left blank.

## Using the Gravatar Integration

Glide will automatically find and add the icons or photos associated with users who have a Gravatar profile in that user’s row. If a user doesn’t have a Gravatar profile, Glide will show the default Gravatar icon instead.
