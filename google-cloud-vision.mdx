# Google Cloud Vision

Integrate vision detection features in your app

### Google Cloud Vision - Block 1

[Google Cloud’s Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision) allows you to use the [Vertex AI Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-vision) environment to build and manage applications. Vision enables computers and systems to interpret and analyze visual data and derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs. These are known as Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, models. In Glide, you can use the **Google Cloud Vision** integration to extract text from PDFs and image files.

## Features

The Google Cloud Vision integration in Glide currently supports two features:

1. Extract text from PDF files
2. Extract text from image

### Extract text from PDF files

The **Extract text from PDF files** feature lets you select a PDF file, and Google Cloud Vision will extract text from the document. You can then use that text in your app. Google Cloud Vision has [a five page limit ](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/file-small-batch)on extracting text from PDF files, so only five pages can be extracted at a time. 

The action can be added to a [Component](/components) that supports [Actions](/actions) (e.g., a [Button component](/button-components)), added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor).

The **Extract text from PDF **feature is not available as a computed column.
