# Date Pickers

Pick a date or date and time.

### Date Pickers First Half

## Pick a date or date/time

Date Pickers can be used in [Forms](/forms) or [Details/Custom screens](/screens) to allow users to add or edit dates in your app. Depending on the type of Date Picker that you select, users will be asked to enter a date, or both date and time values.

## Types of date pickers

The **Date** component allows users to add or edit dates in your app.

The **Date Time** component allows users to add or edit dates and times in your app.

### [BLANK] Date Component default

The **Date** component will automatically choose 12:00 AM as the time for inputted dates, though this is not visible to users unless you choose a **Date & Time** format for your column. If you'd like to capture a different time for entered dates, use the **Date Time** component.
