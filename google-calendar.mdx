# Google Calendar

Add events to your Google Calendar

### Google Calendar

### Google Calendar - Block 1

The [Google Calendar](https://workspace.google.com/products/calendar/) integration allows your app to send new events directly to your team's calendar and invite other attendees. When your team shares one calendar, it can be useful to configure Glide to add events to your team calendar.

## Features

All features of the Google Calendar action can be added to a [Component](/components) that supports [Actions](/actions) (e.g., a [Button component](/button-components)), added to an action sequence in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor), or after a [Form](/forms) is submitted.

### Add calendar event

The **Add calendar event** action allows you to add an event to your Google Calendar. An event title and start time are required, but we recommend also including a duration in minutes (so that an end time is generated).

### Google Calendar - Block 3

1. Select the component you'd like to add the** **action to. Remember, this must be a component that supports actions.
2. Search for the **Add calendar event **action or navigate to Integrations -> Google Calendar -> Add calendar event.
3. Name the action.
4. Choose an icon.
5. Choose which column will provide the **Event title **field, or enter custom text.
6. Choose which column will provide the **Start date **field, or enter custom text.
7. Choose which column will provide the **Duration **field, or enter custom text.
8. Optionally, you can choose columns or enter custom values for the event description, location, and attendees.
9. Select which Google Calendar to add the event to from the **Calendar ID **menu.
10. Decide what updates to send, if any. 
11. You can also choose a column in Glide to store the resulting Event ID. We recommend doing this so that you can then edit or delete that event with a further action. 

You can create a dynamic event by first creating a [Template column](/template-column) in the [Data Editor](/data-editor) and then setting that column as one of your action’s fields.
