# Show Notification

Show a notification message on screen.

### Show Notification Body Text 1

The **Show Notification** action shows a brief pop-up notification with text and an icon.

The **Show Notification** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [Collections](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows).

## **Setting up the Show Notification Action**

### In the Layout Editor

### Show Notification Body Text 2

1. Click on the plus (+) sign in the **Components** panel and select the **Component** you want to trigger the action.
2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and select **Show notification**.
3. Select the icon and descriptive text to use in your app. **Success** shares the descriptive text on a green background, and **Failure** shares the descriptive text on a red background.
4. You can optionally add **Conditions** for certain criteria to be met before a user can trigger this action.

### Show Notification Body Text 3

1. Select the **+ New Workflow **button. If you have existing actions, click on the plus (+) sign in the left panel.
2. Select the **data source** for your action.
3. Configure your first action by clicking the first step in the workflow. You can also add conditions to your actions, if needed.
4. Choose whether the notification will be for success or failure. To create notifications for both situations, you'll need to set up two different actions. 
5. To add new actions to the flow, hover just underneath a step and click the plus button. In this way you can add the Show Notification action as just one step in a larger workflow.
