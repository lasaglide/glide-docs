# Joined List

Join multiple values together into a single value.

### Joined List Body Text 1

The **Joined List** computed column joins or concatenates many values into a single text value. For example, it could join the list of names:

- Alice
- Bob
- Susan

Into a text list like "Alice, Bob, Susan". 

The Joined List column also allows you to choose how you separate these different values. By default, all values are separated by a comma. You can add whatever you want as a separator, including a value from another column.
