# Current Date/Time

Submit the current date and time automatically.

### Current Date/Time Body Text

The **Current Date/Time** is a special value that records the exact date and time a user does something. It can be used in custom [Actions](/getting-started/introduction-to-actions), [Forms](/use-cases/forms) and add/edit screens.

## Configuring Current Date/Time Values

1. In the [Layout Editor](/intro-to-layout), select the component that triggers the form or action you want to add the current date and time to.
2. Click on the plus (+) symbol in the [Components](/components) panel and select **Special Values -> Current Date/Time** component.
3. In the panel on the right of the Layout Editor, select the target column where you want to record the current date and time.

You can set up your target column as a **Date & Time column** in the [Data Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor) to set your preferred date/time format. Otherwise, you'll have a record that looks like this: **2020-04-01T11:00:21.496Z**

### [BLANK] Respect Time Zones Callout

Note that when creating Date and Time values, there is a **Respect time zones **box that is checked automatically. This considers the user's time zone when calculating the value. 

This box will not appear if your table is [Google Sheets](/essentials/data-sources/google-sheets).
