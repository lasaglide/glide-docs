# Import File

Add data from files saved locally on your computer.

### Import File - Block 1

The **Import** feature allows you to upload data files saved on your computer into Glide apps. The supported file formats include:

- [Microsoft Excel](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/essentials/data-sources/microsoft-excel) spreadsheet (.xlsx)
- Comma-separated values file (.csv)
- OpenDocument Spreadsheet (.ods)



### [BLANK] Import File - Callout 1

Data files can be imported into both Glide Tables and Glide Big Tables.

### Import File - Block 2

You can upload these files three ways—while setting up a new app, by adding a new data source in the [Data Editor](/docs/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor), and importing data into an existing Glide Table.

1. The sheets in your file are added as individual tables in the **Data Editor**. Since the original file is saved on your computer, any changes you make there will not affect the table in Glide and vice versa.
2. When the imported file includes columns that aren’t found in the current table, new columns are added to the end of the table.
