# Text to Boolean

Transform text into a true/false output.

### Text to Boolean Body Text 1

Use the **Text to Boolean** feature when you wish to transform a text input into a boolean true/false output. Is a statement true or false? Is the statement true or false based on a certain context? The **Text to Boolean **feature does this analysis for you. 

## Adding the Text to Boolean Feature

### In the Data Editor

### Text to Boolean Body Text 2

1. Open the table where you want to use the **Text to Boolean** column.
2. Add a new basic text column for the **Input**. Any text column can be used for the input, so if you've created a computed column with a text result, you can use that column as well.- New columns added with the plus button will always appear on the right. If you'd like to add a column somewhere else in your data, you can select the dropdown menu on an existing column and choose **Add column right.** You can also click and drag columns to rearrange them.
3. Add a **Text to Boolean** column to store the result. Search for “Text to Boolean” or navigate to AI → Text to Boolean. 
4. For **Instructions,** enter custom text to create more specificity for your prompt.
5. For the **Input**, select the **Input** column created previously.
6. **Note:** If the action is to be triggered in the Workflow Editor, then add a [Basic Boolean Column](/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor/basic-columns) where the result will be stored.
7. Click on **Done**.

### In the Layout Editor

3. In the configuration panel on the right, in the **Actions** menu, select **Text to Boolean.**
4. Name the action and choose an icon.

7. For **Results, **select the column where the results should be stored. 
8. To display the text that results from the action, add a [Text Component](/essentials/components/text) and use your results column as the source. This will instantly show the generated text to your users. 
9. To enable users to adjust the instructions, add a [Text Entry Component](/essentials/components/entry) pointing to an **Instructions** column with the adjustments you want made.
10. To enable users to adjust the input, add a [Text Entry Component](/essentials/components/entry) pointing to the **Input** column to be able to change the input.
