# Stopwatch

Track elapsed time in seconds within your app.

### Stopwatch - Block 1

The **Stopwatch** component allows users to measure time intervals by pressing a button to start and stop a stopwatch. Users can start, pause, and reset the timer as needed.

### [BLANK] Stopwatch - Callout 1

The Stopwatch component is currently in Beta. To use this feature, go to your team's **Settings** and enable preview mode.

### Stopwatch - Block 2

## Setting Up the Stopwatch Component



### Stopwatch - Arcade 1

### Stopwatch - Block 3

1. Create a [Number](/essentials/basic-columns/numbers) or Text column to store the recorded time in seconds.
2. In the [Layout Editor](/getting-started/intro-to-layout#layout-editor), select the screen to edit.
3. Click on the plus symbol in the [Components](/essentials/components) panel.
4. Select **Stopwatch** or search for **Stopwatch**.
5. Drag the component to the position you want in the component menu.

The component can also be added within a [Collection](/essentials/components/collections), which enables the component to be repeated and applied to every item in that collection.

### **Options**

Like all components, you can add [visibility conditions](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/reference/user-experience/visibility-conditions) in the **Options** tab of the configuration menu, Custom CSS to manually adjust the styling of the component, and notes for internal use.
