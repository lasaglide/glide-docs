1. Open the table where you want to use the **Text to Choice** column.
2. Add a new basic text column for the **Input**. The input can be any column that contains text, so if you’ve used another action or computed column to create a text result, you can also use that text result as the **Input** source. - New columns added with the plus button will always appear on the right. If you'd like to add a column somewhere else in your data, you can select the dropdown menu on an existing column and choose **Add column right. **You can also click and drag columns to rearrange them.
3. Add a **Text to Choice** column to store the result. Search for “Text to Choice” or navigate to **AI → Text to Choice.**
4. For **Instructions,** enter custom text to create more specificity for your prompt.
5. ** **For **Input, **use the** Input **column created previously.
6. For **Choices**, enter the choices you'd like to use as a comma-separated list. Note that the choices cannot be an array. 
7. **Note:** If the action will be triggered in the Workflow Editor, then add a basic text **Result** column where the result will be stored.
8. Click on **Done**.
