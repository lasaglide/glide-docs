# File and Image Pickers

Let users upload files and images to your apps.

### File and Image Pickers Body 1

The **File Picker** and **Image Picker** components allow users to upload files and images to your apps. Once a user uploads a file or an image, Glide converts these files to links that can be displayed in your apps or downloaded by users.

## Adding File and Image Picker Components

You can add a file or image picker as a standalone component, or as part of a form in a form container. To set it up:

### File and Image Picker Arcade

### File and Image Pickers Body 2

1. In the [Layout Editor](/intro-to-layout), select the tab you want to edit.
2. Click on the plus (+) symbol in [Components** **](/components)panel.
3. Select **Image Picker **or **File Picker**, depending on what you want your users to upload.
4. Select which column in your [Data Source](/data-sources) the file link should be stored in. Make sure this is a column that supports a file or an image. 
5. Give the component a title in the **Label **field so users know what they should upload.

## Customizing the Image Picker

### Image Source

When setting up the Image Picker you can decide if users can upload photos directly from their camera, or from both their camera and their device.

### Uploading Multiple Images

To allow users to upload multiple images at once, first create a **Multiple Images** column in the [Data Editor](/data-editor). When you use this column for the image picker, the component will automatically allow users to upload multiple images at once. Multiple image uploads are only possible with Glide Tables or Big Tables.

## Customizing the File Picker

When setting up the File Picker, you can choose to keep the native file name the user made, or create a new file name when the file is uploaded.

## Security and Storage Quotas

Files and images are uploaded to Glide's server, and there is a storage limit based on your team's current plan. Check out Glide's [pricing guide](https://www.glideapps.com/pricing) to learn more about the different plans that are available.
