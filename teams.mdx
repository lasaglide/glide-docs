## Managing notification emails

Glide sends email notifications about usage and action errors to team members. Members can manage their own email notifications by navigating to the Members section of the Team dashboard and clicking on the three dots to the right of their name. Admins can manage email notifications for all members of the team. Only admins can enable email notifications about usage.
