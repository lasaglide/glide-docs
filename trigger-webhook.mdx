# Trigger Webhook

Send data to other apps from Glide.

### [BLANK] Trigger Webhook - Callout 2

For security reasons, webhooks will only work when a user is logged into an app. They will not work with Public apps without sign-in.

### Trigger Webhook - Block 1

Webhooks are a way for apps to send data to other apps. Here, we mean apps in the broadest sense—apps, products, services, and software like Gmail, Facebook, PayPal, and Slack.

Webhooks let these programs speak to each other and to be notified when something happens. For example; when a new payment is made in Stripe, send that data to Slack as a notification.

The **Trigger Webhook** action sends data from Glide to an external app. It can be used as an action in components (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [Collections](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows).

The use cases for the Trigger Webhook action are limitless. Some examples include:

- When a user clicks a button, send the details of the current item as an email
- When a user submits a form, take the attached images, convert them to files and upload them to dropbox
- After a new sale is processed, send the details of that order to your accounting software.

## Understanding Webhooks



### [BLANK] Trigger Webhook - Callout 1

Webhooks can be used in lots of different ways but do require a specific format. Just using the Webhook action alone does not allow you to talk to any service—you need to configure the endpoint correctly.

Read [**Mark's post on the forum**](https://community.glideapps.com/t/please-help-us-test-api-column-and-webhook-action/19920/3) detailing the use of Webhooks.

### Trigger Webhook Block 2

Webhooks in Glide require two pieces of data: the **webhook URL **and the **values **to be sent. The webhook URL will come from whatever service you're connecting to. If you're connecting with Zapier or Make, you'll need to first set up the webhook in those platforms, then add the URL to Glide.

The [values](/reference/values) can come from a variety of places in Glide. They can be:

- Special values such as the [Current Date/Time](/reference/values/current-date-time) and User's Email
- [Column values](reference/values/column-values) 
- [User profile values](/reference/values/user-profile-columns)
- Custom values
