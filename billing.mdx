### Payment History

Payment history is provided directly through Stripe. To view your payment history, click **View All** to open a new window. You will see your current plan, plan renewal date, default payment method, billing contact information, next estimated payment details, and invoice history. The payment method and billing information can be changed directly from this Stripe customer portal.

### Billing Profiles

Each team has its own billing profile. If you manage more than one [team](/reference/account/teams), you can customize the billing settings and payment methods for each one.

## Managing Your Plan

The current plan for your team will appear on the upper right of the Billing menu. You will also see an estimated amount for your next payment, which accounts for both the cost of your plan and updates your team uses. If you have any account credit balance, that will appear above the estimated next payment.

To change plans, select **Manage Plan** and choose which plan to change to.

### Billing - Block 3

You will then be taken to the billing screen to confirm your payment method and billing contact information. Glide accepts valid credit cards as payment. If you have an existing [Link account](https://link.com/) for faster checkout, you can use that as well. If you’re using Google Chrome and have configured Google Pay, that option will appear at checkout. Similarly, if you’re using Safari and have Apple Pay configured, that option will appear at checkout. ACH is available for Enterprise customers only. 

After completing your purchase, a copy of your receipt will be emailed to the billing contact address you have on file. You can also access a copy of the invoice and receipt in the **Payment History** section of the billing menu.

### Upgrading Your Plan

If you are on a paid plan and would like to upgrade, click **Manage Plan,** then **Upgrade Plan** to choose a plan upgrade. You will then see a confirmation page that confirms the new billing period, plan selection, and payment method. 

If you are already on a paid plan, the cost of that plan will apply toward your first payment for the new, upgraded plan.

### Billing - Block 5

When confirming your selection on the checkout screen, you will see an account credit for the difference between your current (more expensive) plan and the plan you are downgrading to. This credit will be automatically added to your account and used to pay for future plan or usage fees. Once this credit runs out, your payment method will be charged for plan and usage fees.

### Canceling Your Plan

Plans can be canceled by selecting **Manage Plan** and then selecting **Cancel Plan** in the Stripe dashboard. When a plan is canceled, it will still be accessible until the end of the billing period has been reached. All canceled plans will convert to free plans at the end of the billing period.

### Enabling Unlimited Usage

Enabling unlimited usage allows you to purchase 10,000 additional updates for $20. If enabled, then updates that exceed your team’s quotas will be charged on your next invoice. If you’re on a free trial and want to activate unlimited usage, you can end your trial early. Ending early will activate unlimited usage immediately, reset your usage cycle, and charge your payment method right away. Updates usage can be tracked on [the usage page of your dashboard.](/getting-started/quick-start/glide-dashboard#usage-and-billing)





### Updates Refund policy

If you accidentally use too many updates, we can offer you a one-time account credit for the overages. [Please contact support for assistance.](billing@glideapps.com)
