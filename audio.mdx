Play and record audio files

### Audio Page Text

Whether it's meeting notes, podcast episodes, or music, audio components provide a simple way to play and record audio files in your app.

There are two types of audio components:

1. Audio, which plays audio
2. Audio Recorder, which records audio

## Adding and configuring the Audio components



### Audio -Arcade 1

### Audio Component - Block 2

1. Select the plus (+) icon in the [Components](/components) panel on the left side of the [Layout Editor](/intro-to-layout).
2. Locate **Content** and select **Audio **or **Audio Recorder.**
3. If it's an Audio component, from the configuration panel select the corresponding column for the data field where your audio files are stored, or choose **Custom **to enter a link to an audio file.- The audio file's URL must have an audio file extension, such as .wav, .mp3, or .m4a, and be publicly accessible.
4. If it's an Audio Recorder component, from the configuration panel select the appropriate column in the **Save To **field where you'd like to store the recorded audio file.

## Audio Hosting

If you are not hosting audio files directly in Glide, then it's important to choose an audio hosting or streaming service to store your files, such as Soundcloud. Hosting audio on Google Drive or Dropbox isn't advised. Neither of those cloud storage locations is a video streaming service and may be unreliable.
