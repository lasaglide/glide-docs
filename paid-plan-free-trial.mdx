# Paid Plan Free Trial

Try the Business plan for 30 days, free.

### Trials renew automatically

Free trials renew automatically. If you do not want to proceed with a paid plan, be sure to cancel the trial before the end of the trial period. 

### Free Trial - Block 1

All Glide users are automatically started on a free plan. Each [paid plan level](https://www.glideapps.com/pricing) unlocks new features to add more power to your Glide apps. With the Business plan free trial, you can unlock the features of a paid Glide plan for a 30-day trial period, for free.

After the trial period ends, your plan will automatically renew for a month of Business. If you choose to downgrade or cancel your trial, any features youâ€™ve added to your apps that require a paid plan will no longer work. To enable these features, upgrade to [a paid plan](https://www.glideapps.com/pricing) that meets your needs.

## Signing Up for a Trial

To get started, open the **Billing** menu in your Glide Dashboard and select **Manage Plan**. Select **Start Trial** and enter your billing information. You will not be charged unless you decide to keep your Business plan after the trial period has ended, or you choose to end your trial early to enable unlimited usage. Once you start the trial, your team will immediately be upgraded to the selected paid plan for the 30-day trial period.

## Canceling a Trial

You can end your trial at any time. If you cancel within the trial period, you will not be charged and your plan will revert to the Free plan. 

Unlimited usage is not available during a free trial, but if you need it before your trial ends, you can choose to end your trial early. Ending your trial early will activate unlimited usage immediately, reset your usage cycle, and charge your payment method right away for the selected paid plan. 

You can review how much time is left on your trial period by selecting **Manage Plan** in the Billing menu. You can also end the trial by downgrading to a different paid level or canceling the paid plan. Once a trial has ended, you cannot start another free trial for any plan level.
