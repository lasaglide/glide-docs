# Show Detail Screen

Show the details screen for a collection item.

### Show Details Screen Body Text 1

The **Show Detail Screen** action takes the user to a screen with the data for the particular **Collection** item or row. By default, Collection items link to their Detail Screen.

The **Show Detail Screen** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [Collections](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows).

## Show Detail Screen Use Case

### Show Details About a Location Item

While the Show Detail Screen action is most commonly found and often used on collection items, you can also use it on other components, such as the [Map Component](/essentials/components/map). Clicking a pin on a map will show basic details (that you can choose while setting up the component) about that location as a pop up. If there are more details you want users to see, you can add a Show Detail Screen item to the map.

For example, if you’re building an app for a property rental agency, you might have a wide range of information about listed properties. You can include the most important information on the map component itself, including:

- the address
- monthly rent
- number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- photo of the property

But the listing will also include other important information, such as the property type, whether parking or in-unit laundry are available, the property’s age, schools nearby, the agent’s contact details, and more. To show users this additional information, you can set up a Show Detail Screen action on the map component by following the steps above. Now, when users click on the basic information that pops up from a map pin, they are taken to the detail screen for that collection item.
