Submit rating values for items.

### Rating Text 1

The **Rating** component lets users rate items in your apps. They can tap and drag through the different values and the rating will be written to your [Data Source](/data-sources).

1. In the [Layout Editor](/intro-to-layout), select the tab you want to edit.
2. Click on the plus (+) symbol in the [Components](/components/) panel.
3. Find **Actions** in the menu and select **Rating**.
4. Select which column to store the users' ratings in the **Save to** field. The Rating component will write a simple number value to your data source. If you want ratings to be specific for each user then you can use [User-specific Columns](/user-specific-columns).
5. Determine the **Max Rating** to accept. This ranges from 3 to 5.

## Ratings in Forms

The Rating component is especially useful in [Forms](/forms). You can collect the users' individual ratings for an item. Learn more about [Rollup Columns](/rollup-column) to then determine average ratings.
