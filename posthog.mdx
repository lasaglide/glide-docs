## Adding and Configuring the Action

To use the PostHog integration, you'll first need to set up a [PostHog account.](https://posthog.com/) Once you have a project API key, you can connect the project in Glide.

1. In **Glide**, click the **Settings** menu.
2. Find the [Integrations](/automation/integrations) section and select PostHog.

5. The **API Host** will default to [https://us.i.posthog.com](https://us.i.posthog.com), but depending on your PostHog region, you may need to change this. Your correct API Host can be found in your settings tab.
6. Under **Person Profiles**, choose either: - **Identified Only**: Creates profiles only for users who have been explicitly identified in PostHog
- **Always**: Creates profiles for all visitors, including anonymous ones

## Track Event

The **Track Event** action allows you to send custom events to PostHog when users interact with your app.

The action can be added to a [Component](/components) that supports Actions (e.g., a [Button component](/essentials/components/button)), added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor), or after a [Form](/use-cases/forms) is submitted.

### Analytics Events Only Work in Live Apps

Tracking custom events only works in live apps when triggered by a user. Note that when testing in the Glide builder, the action will not track data.
