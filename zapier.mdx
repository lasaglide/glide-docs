### Zapier - Block 1

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) allows you to connect different services and apps together to make new automations across your tools. With the Zapier integration, you can connect Glide to Zapier and leverage any App from Zapier—[over 7,000 possibilities](https://zapier.com/apps).

Send data from Glide to Zapier using a webhook. Or use our Zapier integration to manage and manipulate your Glide data from Zapier.

If you’re new to Zapier, we recommend checking out [Zapier Learn](https://learn.zapier.com/) before getting started.

### Zapier - Block 2

A Zap has two parts: a trigger and an action.

1. Trigger: something that happens in an app to start a Zap. In Glide, use the Trigger Webhook action to initiate a Zap.
2. Action: an event a Zap performs after it is triggered

The actions available via the Zapier integration are **Add Row, Delete Row, Edit Row, Get All Rows,** or **Get Row.** To use more than one of these actions, set up a unique Zap for each one.
