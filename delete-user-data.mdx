Entering a user's email will delete [**user-specific data**](/user-specific-data), comments, favorites, login records, and other data pertaining to this user. You still need to remove this user's data from your sheets and tables. You can do this in the [Data Editor](/introduction-to-the-data-editor) or directly in your [Data Source](/data-sources).

### Deleting user data

**Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.**
