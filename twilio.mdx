### Verified phone numbers on Twilio

Twilio allows messaging to different numbers depending on what level of account you have. In some cases, you can only text phone numbers that you’ve verified. [Click here](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223180048-How-to-Add-and-Remove-a-Verified-Phone-Number-or-Caller-ID-with-Twilio) to learn more about verified phone numbers on Twilio.

To send a text with Twilio, select which column the integration should pull phone numbers from, and then input the message text you'd like to send. You can choose to send messages either as SMS or through Whatsapp. 

The actions can be added to a component that supports actions (e.g., a button), added to a workflow in the Workflow Editor, or after a form is submitted.

You can create a dynamic message by creating a [Template Column](/template-column) in the [Data Editor](/data-editor) and then setting that column as your **Message** field.

### Twilio - Examples

Let’s look at a potential use case for this integration.

## Optimizing Delivery Times with Twilio SMS Notifications

SwiftCourier, a premier courier service, coordinates with a network of freelance couriers working from mobile devices. They've encountered a bottleneck in getting couriers to pick up orders as soon as they become available for delivery. They need a way to send real-time order status, etas, and delivery updates to their drivers, who are on both ios and Android devices. Driver’s can opt-in to push notifications from the app, but not all do.

SwiftCourier manages all order data and metrics in Glide, and delivery drivers already have the mobile app on their phones. Currently when a delivery notification needs to be sent, SwiftCourier manually writes an email notification for the assigned courier to arrange pickup.

This process, while functional, isn't scalable as the delivery business grows. Optimization is needed, so they decide to utilize Glide's Twilio integration with their existing mobile app to add more communication channels and improve delivery driver and customer experiences. This setup sends an automatic sms notification to the assigned delivery service or courier when a new order is marked ready for delivery.

### Implementing Twilio Text Messages

After integrating Twilio with their Glide app, they create a custom Twilio action. This action is added to the workflow that marks an order as ready for delivery.

And that's it! Each time an order is marked ready for delivery in Glide, a text message is instantly sent out to the assigned courier.

### Enhancing Twilio Notifications with Delivery Details

SwiftCourier takes this a step further by including pertinent delivery details in the text messages.

In the Orders table in Glide, they add a new [template column](/template-column). This column includes:

- The pickup location
- The delivery destination
- Specific order details



![Template column for SwiftCourier SMS. ](https://images.ctfassets.net/yreygbm72t08/2N5AArGxZ2L47052NCKye3/07a4fdd01d3063f8234fbbd69f184a20/image.png)



They then modify the Twilio notification action to use this template column.

Now, every time an order is ready, a detailed text is automatically dispatched to the assigned courier. This automation makes SwiftCourier's delivery process faster and eliminates manual text messaging, saving valuable hours.

If the order details were stored somewhere else (say, an e-commerce platform like shopify), SwiftCourier could use [Call API](/automation/integrations/call-api) to share data between their Glide app and the e-commerce platform.
