# Document to Text

Extract text from documents. 

### Document to text - Block 1

The **Document to Text** feature extracts text from documents so you can use the raw text as data in your apps. Extracted text will retain the capitalization, line breaks, and loose groupings from the original document. If you use multiple files as the column input, the extracted text will be appended together to form a single string output. PDF, DOCX, XLSX, HTML, and PowerPoint file types are supported.

## Adding the Document to Text Feature

### In the Data Editor

1. Open the table where you want to use the **Document to Text** column.
2. Add a column to store the document(s) by clicking the (+) plus symbol to the right of the table. This can be either a URL column to store one document or a multiple file column to store more than one document.- New columns added with the plus button will always appear on the right. If you'd like to add a column somewhere else in your data, you can select the dropdown menu on an existing column and choose **Add column right.** You can also click and drag columns to rearrange them.
3. Add a  **Document to Text** column to store the result. Search for “Document to Text” or navigate to **AI → Document to Text**.
4. For the **Document** field, use the document column you created previously.
5. **Note:** If the action is to be triggered in the Workflow Editor, then add a basic text **Result** column where the result will be stored.
6. Click on **Done**.
