### Push Notifications - Block 1

## Introduction

**Push notifications** are messages sent to a user's mobile, tablet, or desktop device. These notifications can be sent to a user even when they do not have the app open. Push notifications appear in the notification center of the user’s device.

### System Requirements

- Apple devices: iOS and iPadOS 16.4 (and higher). Deep linking is not possible on Apple devices.
- Android devices: While push notifications are available on android, their reliability is volatile and varies by manufacturer and operating system version.

## Features

To send a push notification to a user, you first need to request the user for permission. Once the user has enabled push notifications for your app, you can then send them a push notification.

### Request to allow push notifications

The **Request to allow push notifications permissions** action is used to ask a user if they would like to allow push notifications. When this action runs, the user will be prompted to allow or not allow push notifications.

You can add this action to a button or add the action as a step in a sequence of a workflow. If the user chooses to not allow push notifications, you will not be able to send them push notifications.
