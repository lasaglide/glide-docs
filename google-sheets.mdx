# Google Sheets

Use Google Sheets as the data source for your Glide app.

### 25,000 Row Limit on Spreadsheet Data Sources

Rows from spreadsheet data sources have a **total cap of 25,000 rows across all tables**. If you need more than 25,000 rows of data in a team, consider a high-scale data source like [Big Tables.](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/essentials/data-sources/big-tables) 

### Google Sheets - Block 1

[Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/) is a cloud-based spreadsheet program that's similar to Excel. You can choose a spreadsheet from your Google account to serve as the [Data Source](/data-sources) for your Glide app. Any plan can export a Google sheet and import the resulting .csv or .xlsx file into Glide. Google Sheets syncing is available starting with the Maker plan. [Browse our plans to find the right fit for you. ](https://www.glideapps.com/pricing)
