# Compose Email

Trigger an email draft on the user's device.

### Compose Email Body 1

The **Compose Email** action allows users to tap a button and trigger an email draft on their device.

The **Compose Email** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [Collections](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows).

## **Setting up the Compose Email Action**

1. Click on the plus (+) sign in the **Components** panel and select the **Contact** or **Button** component.
2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and select **Compose email**.
3. Select the icon and descriptive text to use in your app.
4. Choose the values to add to the draft email. Each field can be filled in with a custom static value, or with dynamic values from a column in your data. The fields you can add values to are:- **To:** The email address or addresses you want to send the message to.
- **Subject:** The subject of the email message.
- **Body:** The body text of the email message.
- **CC:** Send a copy of the email to someone who is not the recipient listed in the **To** field. This can also include multiple email addresses as a comma-separated list.
- **BCC:** Send a copy of the email to someone who is not the recipient listed in the  **To** field. This can also include multiple email addresses as a comma-separated list. When using **BCC**, the recipients cannot view the other recipients who may be included in the **BCC **field, but they can view the email addresses that are included in the **To** and **CC** fields. 
5. You can also leave any of these blank if you don’t need that field.
6. You can optionally add **Conditions** for certain criteria to be met before a user can trigger this action.

If you select the contact component, Glide will automatically display options to dial a phone number, compose SMS, and compose email. To delete any of these options that you don’t need, click on the action and then click on the delete icon.
