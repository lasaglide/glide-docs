# Meta Pixel

Passively track user activity in Facebook Ads Manager. Formerly known as Facebook Pixel.

### Meta Pixel - Block 1

[Meta Pixel](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/) (formerly called Facebook Pixel) is a snippet of JavaScript code that allows you to track visitor activity on your website. Adding the Meta Pixel integration to a Glide app creates user observability in that live app.
