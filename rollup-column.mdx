### Rollup Column Body Text 1

The **Rollup** allows you to perform a calculation on an entire column or a [Relation](/relations). The most basic computation for the rollup is Count.

## Column or Relation Source

For example, the app below has a list of people who all have tasks. The **Tasks** column is a [Relation](/relations) that pulls in every task assigned to each individual person. You can then create a Rollup Column that counts the total number of tasks for each person.
