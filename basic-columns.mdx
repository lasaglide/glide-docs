# Basic Columns

Add and manage basic data like text, numbers, and images.

### Basic Columns Body 1

Basic columns hold normal data values, just like the data in a spreadsheet. Any changes made to basic columns are synced between the [Data Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor)** **and the original data source.

## Available column types

The types of basic columns in Glide include:

- **Text**
- **Number**
- **Boolean**
- **Image**
- **Date & Time**
- **URL**
- **Row ID**
- **Rich Text**
- **Email**
- **Phone Number**
- **Duration**
- **Emoji**
- **Multiple Files**
- **Multiple Images**

## Adding Basic Columns

You can add new basic columns either to your original data source or directly to your table in the **Data Editor**. Adding them in Glide allows you to stay in the **Data Editor** and helps if you want to assign a column type when that column doesn't have data.

1. In the **Data Editor,** open the table you want to edit.
2. Add a new column by clicking on the plus (+) symbol to the right of the table. This will add a new column at the end of the table.- You can also add a new column between existing columns by selecting the dropdown arrow on the column and selecting **Add column to right**. You can drag and reposition all columns to the left or right at any time. 
3. Name your new column.
4. In the **Type** dropdown, choose the basic column type you want to add.
5. Once finished, click **Done** to add the column to the table.

## Changing Column Type

If you've already created a column in your table, you can change its type by editing it. 

1. In the **Data Editor,** open the table you want to edit.
2. Click on the dropdown arrow in the column header and then **Edit**.
3. In the **Type** dropdown, choose the column type you want to change to.

The values in the column will automatically adjust based on the type you select. This is just a preview and won't be saved until you click **Done**.

## Date Formatting Options

When adding **Date & Time** columns, you have the option to configure how this information is displayed.

**Parts:** You can choose to show the date and time, date only, or time only.

**Date format:** The date can be short (1/1/1970, 12:00 AM), medium (1 January 1970 at 12:00 AM), or long (Thursday, January 1, 1970 at 12:00 AM).

**Time format:** Time can be shown with seconds (12:00:00 AM) or without (12:00 AM).

The format of date and time values is specific to your location. For example, the date shows MM/DD/YYYY in the United States and DD/MM/YYYY in the United Kingdom.

### [BLANK] Google Sheets Date Callout

If you're using Google Sheets, the original data source will automatically recognize when you enter a date, time, or date and time and apply the correct format to that cell. Glide's **Data Editor** will then recognize this format and automatically assign a **Date & Time** column type. For other data sources, you may need to manually define this column type.

### Convert Basic Columns to User-specific Columns


When adding a new column, you can also enable the **Column is user-specific** option to turn the basic column into a user-specific Column.

### Basic Columns - Body 3

Once a column is set to user-specific, you can't turn it back to a basic column. For more information, see [User-specific columns](/user-specific-columns).
