# Show Form Screen

Show a form screen for the user. 

### Show Form Screen Body Text 1

The **Show Form Screen** action will display a screen with a **Form Container**.

The **Show Form Screen** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [Collections](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow.](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows)

## **Setting up the Show Form Screen Action**

### In the Layout Editor

1. Click on the plus (+) sign in the **Components** panel and select the **Component** you want to trigger the action.
2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and select **Show form screen**.
3. Select the icon and descriptive text to use in your app.
4. In the **Navigation** field, select how the edit screen should appear: as the current screen, main screen, an overlay, or a slide in.
5. You can optionally add **Conditions** for certain criteria to be met before a user can trigger this action.
6. Once this is done, on the **Screen** (not the components panel), click on the component you selected to trigger the action. A **Form** will appear, which will automatically guess which table to add your form submissions to. To change this, choose a different  **Destination table** from the panel on the right.
7. Each component inside your form can also be customized. The options for customization will depend on what type of component you’re using. For every entry, you can decide if users will be required to fill it out.

### In the Workflow Editor

1. Select the **+ New Workflow** button. If you have existing actions, click on the plus (+) sign in the left panel.
2. Select the **data source** for your action.
3. Configure your first action by clicking the first step in the workflow. You can also add conditions to your actions, if needed.
4. To add new actions to the flow, hover just underneath an action and click the plus button. In this way you can add the Show Form Screen action as just one step in a larger workflow.
