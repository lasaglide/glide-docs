# Glide AI and App Data

Understand how Glide uses app data to train AI models.

### AI and App Data - Block 1

As Glide develops and refines it’s AI features, we will be training AI models to deliver the best results for builders and users. To make the models more effective, accurate, and helpful, Glide will use **app configuration data** when training models.

## Which Data Will Be Used

The data used specifically pertains to how apps are configured in the Glide builder. This includes data about:

- Screen configurations, including component names, types, and order on a screen
- Component configurations, including names, types, options, and actions
- AI Custom Component conversations via chat prompting
- Table and Column titles and the types of columns

## Which Data Will Not Be Used

Glide is solely focused on learning from app structures and configurations to make it easier for developers to build new apps and features. Glide will not use the data and content within apps. The following data will not be used:

- Any of the content within the app, including text, images, files, and other data stored in the app
- Data stored in Glide Tables, Google Sheets, or any data source
