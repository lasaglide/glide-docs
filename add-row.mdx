# Add Row

Add a new row to any table in your app.

### Add Row Body Text 1

The **Add Row** action allows you to add a row to any table in your app.

The **Add Row** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [**Collections**](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows).

## **Setting up the Add Row Action**

### In the Layout Editor

1. Click on the plus (+) sign in the **Components **panel and select the **Component** you want to trigger the action.
2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and select **Add Row**.
3. Select the icon and descriptive text to use in your app, and then choose the **Data Source **or table you want to add the row to.
4. Choose the values to add to each column in the row. You can select **Column Values **or manually enter **Custom Values**.
5. You can optionally add **Conditions** for certain criteria to be met before a user can trigger this action.

### In the Workflow Editor

### Add Row Body Text 3

1. Select the **+ New Action** button. If you have existing actions, click on the plus (+) sign in the left panel.
2. Select the **Data Source** for your action.
3. Configure your first action by clicking the first action in the sequence. You can also add **Conditions** to your actions, if needed.
4. To add new actions to the flow, hover just underneath an action and click the plus button. In this way you can add the Add Row action as just one step in a larger workflow.

## Offline Add Row

With offline add row, users can view the app, but not make changes to the data other than to add a new row. **Offline add row is not available for high-scale data sources like SQL and Big Tables. **

Glide apps are progressive web applications. They operate similarly to a website. For offline mode to work, the end user must load the application on their device. If they lose connectivity, the user can still submit Glide Forms. The data submitted is stored locally on the device, and once connectivity is regained, the data is pushed to your data source.
