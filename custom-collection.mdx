Custom collections are like containers where you can create your own stylized collections. After adding a custom collection, you can then add components and customize what each one will display in your collection. You can group as many components as you like to create the exact collection you need in your app. 

## Adding and Setting Up Custom Collections

4. Give the collection a **Title**.
5. Customize your design options with layout, background, and grid size. 
6. Choose if you'd like to limit the number of items that appear, as well as how many items to show per page. 
7. Set [Visibility Conditions](/visibility-conditions) for your data if needed. 

To change your Custom Collection, go to the [Components](/components) section, click on your collection, and make your desired changes. You can preview each change live as you make adjustments.

## Adding an Action to your Collection

You can add [Actions](/getting-started/introduction-to-actions) to your Custom Collection to allow users to interact with your data. For example, you can add a [Button](/button-component) that takes users to a detailed view of a record or opens a form to submit information to you.
