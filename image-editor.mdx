The **Optimize Image** action will download the image from its source URL and optimize it for storage directly in Glide. The action will change the width to a dimension you specify in pixels and format the file to jpeg. To use the feature:

1. In the Data Editor, create a column to store your image URLs if you don’t have one already.
2. Create a column to store the new, optimized images.
3. In the Layout Editor, select the component you'd like to add the action to. Remember, this must be a component that supports actions.
4. Search for the **Optimize Image** action or navigate to Integrations -> Image Editor -> Optimize Image.
5. Name the action.
6. Choose an icon.
7. Specify what column will be the source of image URLs, or enter a URL manually as a custom value.- Note that image URLs must be 255 characters or less.
8. Input the max width in pixels.
9. Select which column should store the optimized image URLs.
