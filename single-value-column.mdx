# Single Value Column

Retrieve a single value from a column or relation.

### Single Value Column

### Single Value Body Text 1

The **Single Value **column lets you display the same value for every row in a table. The source of that value can be from any other table, from a [Multiple Relation](/relations#multiple-relations) or [Query](/query-column) in the same table, or from an [Array](/make-array) in the same table.

## Adding and Configuring a Single Value Column

1. In the [Data Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor), open the table you want to edit.
2. Add a new column by clicking the plus (+) symbol to the right of the table.- New columns added with the plus button will always appear on the right. If you'd like to add a column somewhere else in your data, you can select the dropdown menu on an existing column and choose **Add column right. **You can also click and drag columns to rearrange them.
3. Give the column a name.
4. For **Type**, search for **Single Value **or navigate to **Computed → Single Value. **
5. Under **Configuration, **the first dropdown **Get **allows you to choose where in that table the single value will be retrieved. You have the options of:- **First:** get the first or topmost value from the source
- **Last:** get the last or end value from the source
- **Random:** get a random value from the source
- **From start:** get a value X number of places from the start of the source
- **From end:** get a value X number of places from the end of the source
6. The second Configuration value **From** allows you to choose the column from your tables from which to retrieve the value.

## Whole Row

The Single Value column can also bring back a Whole Row as opposed to just a single value. You can choose the **Whole Row** option in the **From **dropdown while setting up the row. This allows it to behave similar to a [Relation Column](/automation/computed-columns/relations). It can also be used as a form of Navigation by adding the Show New Screen or Show Detail Screen actions to the Component or Collection item that displays the value in the Single Value column.
