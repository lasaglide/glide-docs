If you'd like to add a column somewhere else in your data, you can select the dropdown menu on an existing column and choose **Add column right. **You can also click and drag columns to rearrange them.
3. Give the column a name.
4. For Type, search for **If → Then → Else **or navigate to **Computed →** **If → Then → Else **from the menu.

## Configuring the If → Then → Else  Column

When configuring this column, remember what each condition should be:

**If: **Your condition or criteria.

**Then: **The result you want to show if your condition is true.

**Else: **the result you want to show if your condition is false (or the default if you have multiple conditions).

While setting the conditions or criteria, you can use any of the column values as the data source for any part of the computation. You can also add more than one case in the event that you have multiple criteria to fulfill.
