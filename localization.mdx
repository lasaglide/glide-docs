# Localization

How your apps appear in other languages.

### Localization Body 1

With traditional app development, localizing your app takes a considerable amount of effort. Glide makes this process automatic, so you don't have to worry about translating all the elements within your app.

Localization is available in the Layout Editor and when users view a live app on a device. Localization features do not appear in the Data or Workflow Editors. 

### [BLANK] Language Options Callout

Glide does not offer a native option to change the language. The language of your app adjusts according to the language settings on your device.

### Localization Body 2

## Examples

The example below shows that only the search bar placeholder text is translated, while the rest of the content remains the same.

In this image, the app is live. The Info screen's buttons, title, and content are automatically translated.
