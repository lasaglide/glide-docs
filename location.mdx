# Location

Log the device's current location.

### Location Body Text 1

The **Location** component logs a one-time location that does not update after it is enabled. For dynamic location detection, you may consider using a [Distance to Location](/distance-to-location) Computed Column, which updates as the user's location changes.

## Setting up the Location Component

1. In the [Layout Editor](/getting-started/intro-to-layout), select the tab you want to edit.
2. Click on the plus (+) symbol in the [Components](/essentials/components) panel.
3. Select the **Location** component.
4. In the **Save to** field, select which column in your app's [Data Source](/essentials/data-sources) to store the user's current coordinates.- You can store coordinates in a [text column](/basic-columns).
5. You can add a description in the **Label **field that will show for the user. This field also can be configured using a column in your data sheet.

The Location component is particularly useful in [Form](/forms) screens if your users are submitting location data. Once they have submitted their data, you can plot it on a map with the [Map Component](/map-component).
