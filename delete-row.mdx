# Delete Row

Delete a row of data from a table.

### Delete Row - Block 1

The **Delete Row** action allows users to remove a specific row of data from your [**data source**](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/essentials/data-sources). This can be applied to a single row, or to multiple rows that are connected through a [Multiple Relation](/automation/computed-columns/relations#multiple-relations).

## **Setting up the Delete Row Action**

### In the Layout Editor

2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and select **Delete Row**.- Note: for some components, like Collections, actions are configured in their own tab, next to the **General **and **Options** tabs. 
3. Select what icon and text to use in your action, and then specify which row should be deleted.

1. Select the **+ New Workflow** button. If you have existing workflows, click on the plus (+) sign in the left panel.
2. Select the **data source** for your action.
3. Configure your first action by clicking the first step in the sequence. You can also add conditions to your actions, if needed.
4. To add new actions to the flow, hover just underneath an action and click the plus button. In this way you can add the Delete Row action as just one step in a larger workflow.
