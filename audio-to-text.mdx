# Audio to Text

Transcribe an audio file into text. 

### Audio to Text Body Block 1

## Audio to Text

With the **Audio to Text **feature, you can transcribe an audio recording into text. Audio files should be uploaded directly to Glide. You can do this with a [File Picker Component](/essentials/components/file-and-image-pickers), or by recording directly to your app with an [Audio Component](/essentials/components/audio).

### File types and size restrictions

Glide supports the following audio file types: `mp3`, `mp4`, `mpeg`, `mpga`, `m4a`, `wav`, and `webm
`
File uploads are currently limited to 25 MB.

### Record audio and upload file components

[Record Audio](/essentials/components/audio) and [Upload File](/essentials/components/file-and-image-pickers) are possible via dedicated components and are not actions in and of themselves. To use these features, add them as components in the Layout Editor. Because they are Components and not Actions, they cannot be used in Custom Actions.
