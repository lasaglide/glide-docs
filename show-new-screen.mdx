# Show New Screen

Create a new screen for the user. 

### Show New Screen Body Text 1

With the **Show New Screen** action, you can create new screens for users in your app.

This is different from the **Go to Tab** action, where you should already have create a Tab to move the user to. With Show New Screen, you can link to a data source and customize that screen however you like while setting up this action.

The **Show New Screen** action can be used as an action in the components of your app (like [Buttons](/essentials/components/button), [Collections](/essentials/components/collection), and much more), or it can be triggered along with other actions as part of a [Workflow](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows).

## **Setting up the Show New Screen Action**

### In the Layout Editor

1. Click on the plus (+) sign in the **Components** panel and select the **Component** you want to trigger the action.
2. In the **General** tab on the right side of the Layout Editor, navigate to the **Actions** section and select **Show new screen**.
3. Select the icon and descriptive text to use in your app
4. In the **Data** field, select the data source from which you want to create the new screen users for users to visit. The new screen's data can come from:- A single relation
- The current item
- Another table in your app
5. In the **Navigation** field, select how the new screen should appear: as the current screen, main screen, an overlay, or a slide in.
6. You can optionally add **Conditions** for certain criteria to be met before a user can trigger this action.
7. Once this is done, on the **Screen** (not the components panel), click on the component you selected to trigger the action. A new screen will appear based on the data source you selected.
8. You can customize the appearance of this screen by clicking on the components in the left panel and customizing their corresponding settings in the right panel. You can also remove components from the left panel if you don’t want them to appear on the new screen. This layout will remain unique to this particular Show New Screen action.

### In the Workflow Editor

1. Select the **+ New Workflow** button. If you have existing actions, click on the plus (+) sign in the left panel.
2. Select the **data source** for your action.
3. Configure your first action by clicking the first step in the workflow. You can also add conditions to your actions, if needed.
4. To add new actions to the flow, hover just underneath an action and click the plus button. In this way you can add the Show New Screen action as just one step in a larger workflow.

### **Linking to a relation**

If you have created [**Relations**](/relations) in your table, then you can choose those relations as the source for your new screen. Note that only single relations can be used.

### **Linking to this item**

This feature allows you to display a completely new **Details Screen** for the target row that is independent from the default details screen. Any changes you make to the appearance of this new details screen view will not affect the appearance of the default details screen view, and vice versa.

The feature is tied to the individual action you create, and you can make multiple **Show New Screen** actions for the same row of data. Doing so will create a separate screen for each action you trigger, providing a different view of the targeted data.

### **Linking to another table**

Linking to another table acts just like adding a new tab and picking a table. Once you've picked the table and clicked through to the new screen, you'll be able to customize it with its own layout as shown above.
