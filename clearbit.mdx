### Adding Clearbit Arcade

### Clearbit - Block 2

1. In **Glide**, click the **Integrations** menu.
2. Find the **Integrations **section and then select **Clearbit.**
3. Click the **Add **button.
4. You will need your Clearbit **Secret API key **to finish configuring the integration.
5. You can find your Clearbit Secret API key in your [Clearbit dashboard](https://dashboard.clearbit.com/api). It's usually a 35-character string of letters and numbers starting with **`sk_`**

## Enrich contact

The **Enrich contact** feature can be used as an action or as a computed column to enrich a contact with Clearbit data. The email of the contact to enrich is required, so the integration will sync with the contact in Clearbit. The Clearbit result column in Glide is not required, but if left blank your action will not save any data to your Glide app—it will only enrich the contact in Clearbit. 


### Enrich Contact Arcade

### Clearbit - Block 3

The action can be added to a [Component](/components) that supports [Actions](https://www.glideapps.com/docs/actions) (e.g., a [Button component](/button-components)), added to an action sequence in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor), or after a [Form](/forms) is submitted.

You can edit the column’s configuration to save a different result from Clearbit.
