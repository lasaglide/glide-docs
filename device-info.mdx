# Device Info

Get information about the users device.

### Device Info - Block 1

Device Info lets you retrieve information about the user’s device. For example, you could work out their screen size, whether they are on Android or iOS, or what browser they are using.

You can then use that information as simple analytics in your database to see how your users interact with your app—or use [Conditions](/conditions-filtering-and-visibility) to show different things.

For example, in the welcome screen below, install instructions are shown based on the fact the user is viewing on iOS.

## Adding and Configuring the Integration



### Device Info Adding Arcade

### Device Info - Block 2

1. In Glide, click the Settings icon in the upper-right corner.
2. Navigate to the [Integrations](/automation/integrations) tab and then select Device Info.
3. Click the **Add to app **button.

## Features

The Device Info integration has only one feature: **Get device info**. It can be used as an [Action](/automation/actions), or as a [Computed Column](/computed-columns). The following device attributes are available:

- `DeviceType`
- `BrowserName`
- `BrowserVersion`
- `DeviceBrand`
- `DeviceName`
- `Gpu`
- `IsTouchScreen`
- `OsName`
- `OsVersion`
- `ScreenDensity`
- `ScreenHeight`
- `ScreenWidth`
- `WindowHeight`
- `WindowWidth`



### [BLANK] Device Info - Callout 1

Not all devices will support all device attributes. Some devices may only support some, and this will vary from device to device.

### Device Info - Block 3

## As a Computed Column

Device info can be used in the [Data Editor](/introduction-to-the-data-editor) as a [Computed Column](/computed-columns) found in the group of columns called [Integrations](/automation/integrations). When added as a column, the device info attribute will be applied to all rows in the table.

It’s important to note that when used as a Computed Column, the value returned will only be available to the current user. If you want to gather information about all of your users' devices, then you should use it as an [Action](/automation/actions), so that the results are stored in [Basic Columns](/basic-columns).
