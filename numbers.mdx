# Numbers

Add numbers to your app.

### Numbers - Block 1

**Number columns** can hold four different types of values in your app:

- Numerical values or numbers
- Phone numbers
- Dates & Times
- Durations

### Numbers - Block 2

A **Numbe**r column holds numerical values. This can be used for a wide range of purposes such as weights, distance, volume, area, temperate, cost, income, etc.

You can customize a number column when adding it to your [**data source**](/docs/essentials/data-sources) in the following ways:

- **Precision** allows you to select how many decimal places you want to include in the number.
- **Units **allows you to type in custom values for the type of number displayed, e.g. $, lbs, °F, feet. You can choose to display the units before or after the number in your app.

You can display this information in your app using various [**Components**](/docs/essentials/components), or as [**Column Values**](/docs/reference/values/column-values) when setting up [**Collections**](/docs/essentials/components/collections) and components. The appearance of the numerical values in your app depends on the formatting options available for the chosen component.

You can use the number column in lots of different ways by using them as the source for computed columns and integrations. For example, you can configure a [**Rollup Column**](/docs/automation/computed-columns/rollup-column) and calculate the sum, average, range, etc. of all the values in the column.

## Phone number

### Numbers - Block 3

An **Phone number** column holds phone numbers. You can display the values in this column in your app using any component that displays a text value or as Column Values when setting up collections and components. You can use the values in this column in multiple [**Actions**](/docs/getting-started/introduction-to-actions) like [**Dial Phone Number**](/docs/automation/actions/dial-phone-number) and [**Compose SMS**](/docs/automation/actions/compose-text-message), as well as with integrations like [**Twilio**](/docs/automation/integrations/twilio).

## Date & Time

### Numbers - Block 4

A Date & Time column can hold calendar dates and time values. When setting up the column in the [**Data Editor**](/docs/getting-started/introduction-to-the-data-editor), you can choose from the following options:

- **Parts** enables you to decide if you want to store both the date and the time, the date only, or the time only.
- If you choose date and time or date only, you can choose the **Date Format** to display:- Short (mm/dd/yyyy or dd/mm/yyyy depending on your local settings)
- Medium ( October 2023)
- Long (Thursday, 5 October 2023)
- If you choose date and time or time only, you can choose the **Time Format** to display:- Without seconds (hh:mm)
- With seconds (hh:mm:ss)



### [BLANK] Numbers - Callout 1

When importing date values to Glide, we recommend using ISO formatted dates in your source data. [You can read more about ISO date and time standards here. ](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/iso-8601/)

### Numbers - Block 5

### Use Cases for Date & Time Column

1. Add static values to the column from the Data Editor. For example, for an employee directory, you can add the date an employee joined the company.
2. For a project management app, you can use a Date & Time column to set due dates for tasks.
3. Use values in a Date & Time column with the **Date Difference Column **to calculate the time elapsed since a certain date or the time to a certain date.
4. Add the column to a form to record the time the form was submitted. To do this, use the Current Date & Time component while configuring the form, and choose the Date & Time column to which you’d like to record the submission date.

## Duration



### Numbers - Arcade 4

### Numbers Block 6

The **Duration** column stores days—entered as whole numbers or decimals—displayed in hh:mm:ss format. For example, 1 day will display as 24:00:00, 1.5 days will display as 36:00:00, etc. It is always displayed in hours, and the minute and seconds portions of the time format do not display. It is meant to be used with a calculation already done in a synced data source such as Airtable or Google Sheets.

To see the duration between two distinct times, we recommend using the **Date & Time** columns to capture start and end dates/times, and then using the [Date Difference Column](/automation/computed-columns/date-difference) to calculate the time between the two.
