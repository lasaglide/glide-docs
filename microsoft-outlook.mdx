Send emails and add calendar events with Microsoft Outlook

### Microsoft Outlook

### Microsoft Outlook - Block 1

[Outlook](https://outlook.live.com/owa/) is an email client and calendar tool that is part of the Microsoft Office and Microsoft 365 product suites. If Microsoft Outlook is a critical part of your workflow, it can be helpful to configure Glide to send emails from your Outlook account or add events to your Outlook calendar.

## Features

### Send Email with Outlook

The **Send Email with Outlook** action allows you to send an email from your own Outlook account. You can add formatting to the body of the email with HTML. 

The action can be added to a [Component](/components) that supports [Actions](/actions) (e.g., a [Button component](/button-components)), added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor), or after a [Form](/forms) is submitted.

To create dynamic emails, it's best to make sure your data table is set up before you start configuring your action. The data for the fields To, Cc, Bcc, Subject, and Body, therefore, needs to be available in one of the following:

- the table shared by the screen and action
- the [User Profile table](/reference/security-and-user-data/user-profiles)
- [Special values](/reference/values/introduction-to-values) that are the current date/time, unique identifier, user’s email address, or link to the current screen

Columns such as text, template, or single value are well suited to generate the subject line and body of the email. If the Body field points to an image column, the email received will display the URL of the location of the image.

- Recipient fields (To, Cc, Bcc): create columns that will house email addresses. These could be basic text, a joined list, a split text, or array columns.
- Subject line: a text or template column.
- Body: a text or template column.

### Add calendar event

The **Add calendar event** action allows you to add an event to your Outlook calendar. If you don't specify a calendar ID, Glide will create the event on your primary calendar.

The action can be added to a [Component](/components) that supports [Actions](/actions) (e.g., a [Button component](/button-components)), added to a workflow in the [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/introduction-to-workflows#the-workflow-editor), or after a [Form](/forms) is submitted.

You can create a dynamic event by first creating a [Template column](/template-column) in the [Data Editor](/data-editor) and then setting that column as one of your action’s fields.

### [BLANK] Microsoft Outlook - Callout 3

You can add multiple attendees by separating each with a comma and a space. For example: person@heyglide.com, anotherperson@heyglide.com
