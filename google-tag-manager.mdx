# Google Tag Manager

Track user behavior with Google Tag Manager.

### Google Tag Manager - Block 1

[Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/#/home) is a tag management system for web analytics. GTM) is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of managing and deploying tags on your website. Tags are snippets of code that collect data and send it to third-party tools, such as analytics platforms or advertising platforms. GTM provides a centralized platform where you can add, update, and manage these tags without the need for manual coding each time a change is required. 

With the Google Tag Manager integration, you can track user behavior in your Glide app. Data from events created with Google Tag Manager are sent to Google Analytics, so you'll need a Google Analytics account before you get started.

### New Format for Tags

Please note that Google changed the format for GTM tags in September 2023. Te previous format was GTM-xxxxx. New measurement IDs start with G-xxxxx. If your previous tags stop working, you may need to update your measurement ID in the integration settings.
