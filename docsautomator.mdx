### DocsAutomator Example 1

## **Example: Automated Invoice Generation**

SwiftCourier, a reputable delivery service, prides itself on its prompt and efficient operations. However, as their customer base expanded, so did their administrative workload. One such task was creating invoices for each delivery order. Working with paper invoices made it tedious to create automated workflows. SwiftCourier wants to switch to electronic invoices to reduce time-consuming administrative hassle and use their existing invoice data for an automated solution. They need an automated invoice processing workflow. They already built a Glide app to be their internal operations management system, operating like their own erp system on a smaller scale. This app already hastheir pricing, payment options, and notification workflows set up.

This is where the DocsAutomator integration came into play.

### **Setting Up Invoice Automation**

After integrating DocsAutomator with Glide, SwiftCourier created a Google Doc to serve as the template for their invoices. This template includes placeholders for the invoice details:

- Customer Name
- Delivery Address
- List of Items
- Total Cost
- Date of Delivery

### **Generating the Invoices**

Within the back office app, whenever a customer places an order, a button labeled "Confirm Order" appears. Clicking this button triggers a workflow to finalize order acceptance.

The initial action involves DocsAutomator's "Generate Document" feature to produce the invoice. This action uses the invoice Google Doc template, populating it with order details and generating a unique invoice for that specific order. This reduces the team’s processing time by creating an invoice automation with all the relevant information required for payment processing and invoice payment. This data can then be passed to the invoice processing software used by SwiftCourier’s accounting department. 

### **Distributing the Invoices**

Once generated, the invoice is automatically emailed to the customer. This gives the customer a record of their order and confirmation of its acceptance. The same workflow could be used to generate purchase orders, streamline manual data entry processes, set up recurring invoices, and create an automation system for other bookkeeping tasks. 

### **Invoice Management in Glide**

Not only did the new workflow eliminate human error in invoice creation, but it also ensured customers received prompt and accurate billing information.

SwiftCourier streamlined an important step in their business processes, heightening customer satisfaction and removing manual tasks to improve their invoice processing workflow. They created their own invoice processing solution, custom to their needs, integrated with their other operational workflows.

If SwiftCourier’s accounting system required approval workflows for invoice approval, they could use [roles](/essentials/security-and-user-data/roles) to add an approval process to the automation. They could also set up notifications for late payments, updates about accounts payable, and more.
