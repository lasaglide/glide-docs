# Sort

Sort your lists and collections based on criteria.

### Sort Body Text

By default, your [Collection](/essentials/components/collections) items show in the same order as the rows in your table. However, you can use **Sort** to change this order. 

## Default sort

Select a collection you'd like to sort. In the **Options **tab on the right of the [Layout Editor](/getting-started/intro-to-layout), you'll see **Sort by table order** under **Sort Data**. You can click on this text to customize how your collection is sorted. 

In addition to the default table order option, you can choose to sort randomly or by the values in any column from the table. Your list will be sorted either alphabetically or numerically depending on the data in the column you choose. You can reverse the order of your current sort by clicking the up or down arrows on the right at any time.

Sorting can make more sense of the data in your collections. For example, the app below shows a list of products sorted by price in descending order.
